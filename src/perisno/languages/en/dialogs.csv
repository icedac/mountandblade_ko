dlga_start:close_window.3|This person looks quite busy. I think I shouldn't interrupt...
dlga_start:ovkun_talk|You think you're better than us, huh.
dlga_ovkun_talk:ovkun_talk_2|I have never said anything like that...
dlga_ovkun_talk_2:ovkun_talk_3|So you think I'm stronger than you?
dlga_ovkun_talk_3:ovkun_talk_4|Yes.
dlga_ovkun_talk_4:ovkun_fight_start|I do not like to be mocked.
dlga_ovkun_talk_3:ovkun_reason|Well, no. We are equals. So it would not be smart to start a fight in which both of us may lose, right?
dlga_ovkun_reason:close_window|Well, you are right about that. I want to lose in a fight no more than you. I hope to see you again.
dlga_ovkun_talk:ovkun_fight_start|I certainly am!
dlga_ovkun_fight_start:close_window|I'll wipe that smirk right off your face!
dlga_member_chat:khivachis_talk|It is an honor to be a part of your fine company of men.
dlga_khivachis_talk:skills_k1|I want to see your skills.
dlga_skills_k1:skills_k2|Very well.
dlga_skills_k2:khivachis_talk|Done.
dlga_khivachis_talk:close_window|I think we need to part our ways.

dlga_start:fighter_talk|Hello there. We are polishing off our combat skills here with a bit of sparring practice.You look like you could use a bit of training. Why don't you join us, and we can show you a few tricks.And if you need explanation of any combat concepts, just ask, and I will do my best to fill you in.
dlga_start:fighter_talk.1|What do you want to practice?
dlga_fighter_pretalk:fighter_talk|Tell me what kind of practice you want.
dlga_fighter_talk:fighter_talk_train_attack|I want to practice attacking.
dlga_fighter_talk:fighter_talk_train_parry|I want to practice blocking with my weapon.
dlga_fighter_talk:fighter_talk_train_combat|Let's do some sparring practice.
dlga_fighter_talk:close_window|[Leave]
dlga_fighter_talk_train_attack:fighter_talk_train_attack_2|All right. There are four principle directions for attacking. These are overhead swing, right swing, left swing and thrust. Now, I will tell you which direction to attack from and you must try to do the correct attack.^^(Move your mouse while you press the left mouse button to specify attack direction. For example, to execute an overhead attack, move the mouse up at the instant you press the left mouse button.The icons on your screen will help you do the correct action.)
dlga_fighter_talk_train_attack_2:close_window|Let's begin then. I am ready.
dlga_fighter_talk_train_attack_2:fighter_pretalk|Actually I want to do something else.
dlga_fighter_talk_train_parry:fighter_talk_train_parry_2|Unlike a shield, blocking with a weapon can only stop attacks coming from one direction.For example if you block up, you'll deflect overhead attacks, but you can still be hit by side swings or thrust attacks.^^(You must press and hold down the right mouse button to block.)
dlga_fighter_talk_train_parry_2:fighter_talk_train_parry_3|I'll now attack you with different types of strokes, and I will wait until you do the correct block before attacking.Try to do the correct block as soon as you can.^^(This practice is easy to do with the 'automatic block direction' setting which is the default.If you go to the Options menu and change defend direction control to 'mouse movement' or 'keyboard', you'll need to manually choose block direction. This is much more challenging, but makes the game much more interesting.This practice can be very useful if you use manual blocking.)
dlga_fighter_talk_train_parry_3:close_window|Let's begin then. I am ready.
dlga_fighter_talk_train_parry_3:fighter_pretalk|Actually I want to do something else.
dlga_fighter_talk_train_combat:fighter_talk_train_combat_2|Sparring is an excellent way to prepare for actual combat.We'll fight each other with non-lethal weapons now, until one of us falls to the ground.You can get some bruises of course, but better that than being cut down in the real thing.
dlga_fighter_talk_train_combat_2:close_window|Let's begin then. I am ready.
dlga_fighter_talk_train_combat_2:fighter_pretalk|Actually I want to do something else.
dlga_start:fighter_parry_try_again|Good. You were able to block my attacks successfully. You may repeat this practice and try to get faster each time, until you are confident of your defense skills. Do you want to have another go?
dlga_start:fighter_parry_try_again.1|Well that didn't go too well, did it? (Remember, you must press and hold down the right mouse button to keep your block effective.) Do you want to try again?
dlga_fighter_parry_try_again:fighter_talk_train_parry|Yes. Let's try again.
dlga_fighter_parry_try_again:fighter_talk_leave_parry|No, I think I am done for now.
dlga_start:fighter_parry_warn|Hey! We are doing a blocking practice, mate! You are supposed to block my attacks, not attack me back.
dlga_fighter_parry_warn:fighter_talk_train_parry|I am sorry. Let's try once again.
dlga_fighter_parry_warn:fighter_talk_leave_parry|Sorry. I must leave this practice now.
dlga_fighter_talk_leave_parry:close_window|All right. As you wish.
dlga_start:fighter_combat_try_again|Well that didn't go too well, did it?  Don't feel bad, and try not to do same mistakes next time. Do you want to have a go again?
dlga_fighter_combat_try_again:fighter_talk_train_combat|Yes. Let's do another round.
dlga_fighter_combat_try_again:fighter_talk_leave_combat|No. That was enough for me.
dlga_fighter_talk_leave_combat:close_window|Well, all right. Talk to me again if you change your mind.
dlga_start:fighter_combat_try_again.1|Hey, that was good sparring. You defeated me, but next time I'll be more careful. Do you want to have a go again?
dlga_start:fighter_talk.2|Very good. You have learned how to attack from any direction you want. If you like we can try this again or move to a different exercise.
dlga_start:archer_challenge_2|Not bad. Not bad at all! You seem to have grasped the basics of archery. Now, try to do the same thing with a crossbow.Take the crossbow and the bolts over there and shoot those three targets. The crossbow is much easier to shoot with compared with the bow,but you need to reload it after each shot.
dlga_start:archer_challenge_2.1|Good. You didn't have too much difficulty using the crossbow either. Next you will learn to use throwing weapons.Pick up the javelins you see over there and try to hit those three targets. 
dlga_start:ranged_end|Well, with that you have recevied the basic skills to use all three types of ranged weapons. The rest will come with practice. Train each and every day, and in time you will be as good as the best marksmen in Perisno.
dlga_ranged_end:close_window|Now, you can go talk with the melee fighters or the horsemanship trainer if you haven't already done so. They can teach you important skills too.
dlga_start:archer_talk|Good day to you, young {reg33?lass:fellow}. I spend my days teaching about ranged weapons to anyone that is willing to learn.If you need a tutor, let me know and I'll teach you how to use the bow, the crossbow and the javelin.
dlga_archer_talk:archer_challenge|Yes, show me how to use ranged weapons.
dlga_archer_talk:close_window|No, not now.
dlga_archer_challenge:archer_challenge_2|All right. Your first training will be in bowmanship. The bow is a difficult weapon to master. But once you are sufficiently good at it, you can shoot quickly and with great power.Go pick up the bow and arrows you see over there now and shoot those targets.
dlga_archer_challenge_2:close_window|All right. I am ready.
dlga_archer_challenge_2:close_window.1|Just a minute. I want to do something else first.
dlga_start:horseman_melee_challenge_2|I hope you enjoyed the ride. Now we move on to something a bit more difficult. Grab the lance you see over there and ride around the course hitting each target at least once.
dlga_start:horseman_melee_challenge_2.1|Good! You have been able to hit all targets on horseback. That's no easy feat for a starter. Your next challange will be using a bow and arrows to shoot at the archery targets by the road. You need to put an arrow to each target to consider yourself successful.
dlga_start:horsemanship_end|Very good. You were able to shoot all targets from horseback. Keep riding and practicing each day and in time you will be an expert horseman.
dlga_horsemanship_end:close_window|Now, you can go talk with the melee fighters or the archery trainer if you haven't already done so. You need to learn everything you can to be prepared when you have to defend yourself.
dlga_start:horseman_talk|Good day! I have come here for some riding practice, but my old bones are aching badly so I decided to give myself a rest today. If you would like to practice your horsemanship, you can take my horse here. The exercise would be good for her.
dlga_horseman_talk:horseman_challenge|Yes, I would like to practice riding.
dlga_horseman_talk:close_window|Uhm. Maybe later.
dlga_horseman_challenge:horseman_melee_challenge_2|Good. Now, I will give you a few exercises that'll teach you riding and horseback weapon use. Your first assignment is simple. Just take your horse for a ride around the course. Go as slow or as fast as you like. Come back when you feel confident as a rider and I'll give you some tougher exercises.
dlga_horseman_melee_challenge_2:close_window|All right. I am ready.
dlga_horseman_melee_challenge_2:close_window.1|Just a minute. I need to do something else first.
dlga_tutorial_troop_default:close_window|Hey, I am trying to practice here. Go, talk with the archery trainer if you need guidance about ranged weapons.
dlga_start:lord_prison_break_confirm_3|Is there a change of plans?
dlga_start:lord_prison_break|What's going on?
dlga_start:aroulo_meet_on_island_backstory|I can speak your tongue. What is your business here?
dlga_aroulo_meet_on_island_backstory:aroulo_meet_on_island_backstory_1|I am nothing but a merchant, sir.
dlga_aroulo_meet_on_island_backstory_1:aroulo_meet_on_island_backstory_2|Merchant you say? I take it your wares were on that ship?
dlga_aroulo_meet_on_island_backstory_2:aroulo_meet_on_island_backstory_3|Indeed.
dlga_aroulo_meet_on_island_backstory_3:close_window|Well... There are many bandits, is all I can say. I know not who those ones are. It seems you are safe now, I wish you luck in your travels.
dlga_aroulo_meet_on_island_backstory:aroulo_meet_on_island_backstory_attack|My business? I will be having that armor of yours, or I will take it off your dead body.
dlga_aroulo_meet_on_island_backstory_attack:close_window|You are a fool. Okel Jakkaarii!
dlga_start:close_window.4|Oleth hrakkarikh, lanqoyi rhoa.
dlga_start:ovkun_response|Where is Torsson?
dlga_ovkun_response:ovkun_response_died|He died bravely, I am sorry I could not save him.
dlga_ovkun_response:ovkun_response_games|Where is Torsson? That is a very good question; he couldn't make it on the voyage back, perhaps he is still raiding.
dlga_ovkun_response_games:ovkun_response_2|Stop playing games! He is dead, I can see right through you, coward!
dlga_ovkun_response_died:ovkun_response_2|And why did you not die with him, like a true kinsman?
dlga_ovkun_response_2:close_window|He is dead and couragous, you are living and cowardly. Soon you will be dead and cowardly. Draw your spear if you still have any iron in your blood.
dlga_start:falmann_ready|Ready to leave?
dlga_falmann_ready:close_window|Yes, let me be off.
dlga_falmann_ready:close_window.1|Not quite yet.
dlga_start:falmann_response|Well, I see Kvensson has a spear in his throat. I cannot blame you for his death, as he challenged you. However, you are one of two survivors to Torsson's raid. Tell me what happened.
dlga_falmann_response:falmann_disgust|Well, a Valahir Aethling attacked us you see... [admit cowardice]
dlga_falmann_response:falmann_bullshit|Well, he asked Hyk and I to scout ahead you see, and he wasn't there upon our return... [deny cowardice]
dlga_falmann_disgust:falmann_disgust_2|You disgust me.
dlga_falmann_disgust_2:falmann_disgust_3|You do not deserve the very clothes on your back, wrought by better hands than yours.
dlga_falmann_disgust_3:falmann_avenge|*spits* But I will give you another chance. Do not act such a coward again, or you will find me less lenient.
dlga_falmann_bullshit:falmann_avenge|You say you found a bit of cloth with Aethling Svafar's sigil on it when looking at your camp? I have no doubt that it is his doing.
dlga_falmann_avenge:falmann_avenge_2|You must avenge Torsson's death, as the survivor and friend to him. Talk to me when you are ready to sail back to Perisno. I know you may not have the capacity to beat him now, but you have all the time in the world. Svafar's death is your mission.
dlga_falmann_avenge_2:close_window|Thank you for giving me this chance to prove myself. I will not fail in this.
dlga_start:north_merchant_talk|Good day, I am a merchant from south, looking to sell a few of my wares. What can I do for you?
dlga_north_merchant_talk:north_trade_requested|I want to trade. Show me your wares.
dlga_north_trade_requested:north_merchant_trade|Ah, yes. Take a look.
dlga_north_merchant_trade:north_merchant_talk|Anything else?
dlga_north_merchant_talk:north_merchant_gossip|Tell me. What are people talking about these days?
dlga_north_merchant_gossip:north_merchant_talk|Well, nothing new lately. Prices, weather, the wars; the same old things. I know little of what men are talking of here on Hylr, I am simply a merchant trying to find my way to as many remote places as possible to sell my wares and hopefully, find some interesting stories. You could say I'm a bit of an adventurer myself!
dlga_north_merchant_talk:close_window|Good-bye.
dlga_start:close_window.5|I have no words for you, coward.
dlga_start:drunk_response|What are you looking at?
dlga_start:drunk_response.1|Are you looking at me?
dlga_player_duel_response:close_window|Such a waste...
dlga_player_duel_response:close_window.1|Better him than me
dlga_drunk_response:drunk_fight_start|I'm not sure... Some sort of animal, clearly
dlga_drunk_response:dplmc_drunk_attempt_placate|Excuse me -- please accept my apologies
dlga_dplmc_drunk_attempt_placate:close_window|I'll let it slide... this time.  Now buzz off.
dlga_dplmc_drunk_attempt_placate:close_window.1|I'll wipe that smirk right off your face!
dlga_drunk_fight_start:close_window|I'll wipe that smirk right off your face!
dlga_drunk_response:drunk_player_high_renown|Do you have any idea who I am?
dlga_drunk_player_high_renown:drunk_fight_start|Do I care?
dlga_drunk_player_high_renown:drunk_fight_start.1|Big talk from a little runt.  I'll put you in your place!
dlga_drunk_player_high_renown:drunk_player_high_renown|Emmm... Actually... Yes, yes, I do know who you are, {s0}. Please forgive me, your grace -- it must be the drink. I'll be leaving, now...
dlga_drunk_player_high_renown:drunk_fight_start.2|Why, if you want a fight, you shall have one!
dlga_drunk_player_high_renown:close_window|I thought as much. Now, remove yourself from here
dlga_start:fistfight_response|You look like a {reg33?dame:fellow} who can take a few hard knocks -- and deal them out, too. I have a business proposition for you.
dlga_fistfight_response:fistfight_response_2|How's that?
dlga_fistfight_response_2:fistfight_response_2a|Good -- I'm glad you're interested. Here's the plan... It's a little complicated, so listen well. 
dlga_fistfight_response_2a:fistfight_response_3|You and this other fellow will start up a fight here. No weapons, no armor -- I'll sit back and take bets, and split the profits with the winner. If we make a loss, then I'll cover it. You've got nothing to lose -- except a bit of blood, of course.
dlga_fistfight_response_3:fistfight_response_4|However, we can't organize this like one of those nice arena bouts, where everyone places their bets beforehand. People will walk in, drawn by the noise, and put a aurum or two on whichever one of your two they think is winning. I'll give 'em even odds -- anything else is going to be too tricky for someone who's already on his third flagon of ale.
dlga_fistfight_response_4:fistfight_response_4a|So, as you can see, the trick is to stretch things out for as long as possible where it looks like you're losing, and people bet against you -- and then come back fast, and win, before the betting can turn. The best way to make money is for you to be battered almost to the floor, and then jump back off your feet and take the other guy down. However, you have to win in the end in order for me, and you, to make money. 
dlga_fistfight_response_4a:fistfight_response_5|Also, you can't stretch the fight out too long, or people will suspect a fix. So, one of you has to take a punch every so often. I don't care whose blood is spilled, but there has to be some blood.
dlga_fistfight_response_5:fistfight_response_5a|And one other thing -- my mate, your opponent, he doesn't take to well to complexity. So he's just going to come straight at you. It's up to you to supply the artistry.
dlga_fistfight_response_5a:fistfight_response_confirm|So, what do you think?
dlga_fistfight_response_confirm:close_window|  {!}[Yes -- not yet implemented]
dlga_fistfight_response_confirm:close_window.1|I have better things to do
dlga_start:ramun_introduce_1|Good day to you, {reg33?lassie:young man}.
dlga_ramun_introduce_1:ramun_introduce_2|Forgive me, you look like a trader, but I see none of your merchandise.
dlga_ramun_introduce_1:close_window|Never mind.
dlga_ramun_introduce_2:ramun_introduce_3|A trader? Oh, aye, I certainly am that.My merchandise is a bit different from most, however. It has to be fed and watered twice a day and tries to run away if I turn my back.
dlga_ramun_introduce_3:ramun_introduce_4|Livestock?
dlga_ramun_introduce_4:ramun_introduce_5|Close enough. I like to call myself the man who keeps every boat on this ocean moving.Boats are driven by oars, you see, and oars need men to pull them or they stop. That's where I come in.
dlga_ramun_introduce_5:ramun_introduce_6|Galley slaves.
dlga_ramun_introduce_6:ramun_introduce_7|Now you're catching on! A trading port like this couldn't survive without them.The ships lose a few hands on every voyage, so there's always a high demand. The captains come to me and they pay well.
dlga_ramun_introduce_7:ramun_introduce_8|Where do the slaves come from?
dlga_ramun_introduce_8:ramun_introduce_9|Mostly I deal in convicted criminals bought from the authorities.Others are prisoners of war from various nations, brought to me because I offer the best prices.However, on occasion I'll buy from privateers and other . . . 'individuals'. You can't be picky about your suppliers in this line of work.You wouldn't happen to have any prisoners with you, would you?
dlga_ramun_introduce_9:ramun_introduce_10|Me? 
dlga_ramun_introduce_10:ramun_introduce_11|Why not? If you intend to set foot outside this town,you're going to cross swords with someone sooner or later. And, God willing, you'll come out on top.Why not make some extra money off the whole thing? Take them alive, bring them back to me, and I'll pay you fifty aurums for each head.Don't much care who they are or where they come from.
dlga_ramun_introduce_11:ramun_introduce_12|Hmm. I'll think about it.
dlga_ramun_introduce_12:close_window|Do think about it!There's a lot of silver to be made, no mistake. More than enough for the both of us.
dlga_start:ramun_talk|Hello, {playername}.
dlga_ramun_pre_talk:ramun_talk|Anything else?
dlga_ramun_talk:ramun_sell_prisoners|I've brought you some prisoners, Ramun. Would you like a look?
dlga_ramun_talk:ramun_sell_prisoners_all|I want to sell all the prisoners I have with me.
dlga_ramun_sell_prisoners_all:ramun_sell_prisoners_all_2|I'll take your {reg1} {reg2?prisoners:prisoner} off your hands for {reg0} aurums. Do we have a deal?
dlga_ramun_sell_prisoners_all_2:ramun_sell_prisoners_2|We have a deal.
dlga_ramun_sell_prisoners_all_2:ramun_pre_talk|Let me think about it again.
dlga_ramun_sell_prisoners:ramun_sell_prisoners_2|Let me see what you have...
dlga_ramun_sell_prisoners_2:close_window|A pleasure doing business with you.
dlga_ramun_talk:ramun_ask_about_capturing|How do I take somebody as prisoner?
dlga_ramun_talk:ramun_ask_about_capturing.1|Can you tell me again about capturing prisoners?
dlga_ramun_ask_about_capturing:ramun_have_blunt_weapon|You're new to this, aren't you? Let me explain it in simple terms.The basic rule of taking someone prisoner is knocking him down with a blunt weapon, like a mace or a club,rather than cutting him open with a sword. That way he goes to sleep for a little while rather than bleeding to death, you see?I'm assuming you have a blunt weapon with you . . .
dlga_ramun_have_blunt_weapon:ramun_have_blunt_weapon_yes|Of course.
dlga_ramun_have_blunt_weapon:ramun_have_blunt_weapon_no|As a matter of fact, I don't.
dlga_ramun_have_blunt_weapon_yes:ramun_ask_about_capturing_2|Good. Then all you need to do is beat the bugger down with your weapon, and when the fighting's over you clap him in irons.It's a bit different for nobles and such, they tend to be protected enough that it won't matter what kind of weapon you use,but your average rabble-rouser will bleed like a stuck pig if you get him with something sharp. I don't have many requirements in my merchandise,but I do insist they be breathing when I buy them.
dlga_ramun_have_blunt_weapon_no:ramun_have_blunt_weapon_no_2|No? Heh, well, this must be your lucky day. I've got an old club lying around that I was going to throw away.It a bit battered, but still good enough bash someone until he stops moving.Here, have it.
dlga_ramun_have_blunt_weapon_no_2:ramun_have_blunt_weapon_yes|Thanks, Ramun. Perhaps I may try my hand at it.
dlga_ramun_ask_about_capturing:ramun_ask_about_capturing_2|Alright, I'll try and expain it again in simple terms. The basic rule of taking someone prisoner is knocking him down with a blunt weapon, like a mace or a club,rather than cutting him open with a sword. That way he goes to sleep for a little while rather than bleeding to death, you see?It's a bit different for nobles and such, they tend to be protected enough that it won't matter what kind of weapon you use,but your average rabble-rouser will bleed like a stuck pig if you get him with something sharp.
dlga_ramun_ask_about_capturing_2:ramun_ask_about_capturing_3|Alright, I think I understand. Anything else?
dlga_ramun_ask_about_capturing_3:ramun_ask_about_capturing_4|Well, it's not as simple as all that. Blunt weapons don't do as much damage as sharp ones, so they won't bring your enemies down as quickly.And trust me, given the chance, most of the scum you run across would just as soon kill you as look at you, so don't expect any courtesy when you pull out a club instead of a sword.Moreover, having to drag prisoners to and fro will slow down your party, which is why some people simply set their prisoners free after the fighting's done.It's madness. How could anyone turn down all that silver, eh?
dlga_ramun_ask_about_capturing_4:ramun_ask_about_capturing_5|Is that everything?
dlga_ramun_ask_about_capturing_5:ramun_ask_about_capturing_7|Just one final thing. Managing prisoners safely is not an easy thing to do, you could call it a skill in itself.If you want to capture a lot of prisoners, you should try and learn the tricks of it yourself,or you won't be able to hang on to a single man you catch.
dlga_ramun_ask_about_capturing_7:ramun_pre_talk|Thanks, I'll keep it in mind.
dlga_ramun_talk:ramun_leave|I'd better be going.
dlga_ramun_leave:close_window|Remember, any prisoners you've got, bring them to me. I'll pay you good silver for every one.
dlga_ramun_talk:ramun_quest|Do you have any tasks for me?
dlga_ramun_quest:ramun_quest1|Why, of course! Business lately has been absolutely terrible! It seems like people like to kill other people more than to take them prisoner! It is absolutely horrible. Why kill someone with a sword when you can knock them out with blunt weapons and sell them as nice slaves?
dlga_ramun_quest1:ramun_quest2|Why, indeed!
dlga_ramun_quest2:ramun_quest3|Since business is so terrible right now, I am hoping you can capture some prisoners for me. Any prisoner is fine. I will reward you well.
dlga_ramun_quest3:ramun_quest4|Alright! I'll do it. 
dlga_ramun_quest3:close_window|No thanks. Maybe another time, Ramun.
dlga_ramun_quest4:close_window|Excellent! Remember, you need 15 prisoners of any kind.
dlga_ramun_talk:ramun_reward|I have the prisoners!
dlga_ramun_reward:close_window|Excellent! Here is the reward I promised you.
dlga_start:close_window.8|I humbly request that your {reg33?lady:lord}ship keeps {reg33?her:his} hands where I can see them.

dlga_intel_adviser_target:assassin_intro_0|{reg33?Madam:Sir}, it is not unusual for the great and good of this land to be targeted by assassins and the like - you yourself have had a scare or two. As Spymaster, I am in a position to offer you the same service. ^^ Be aware that this type of action, though covert, could affect your reputation if it is discovered that you have had anything to do with it. Would you like to hear your options?
dlga_assassin_intro_0:assassin_intro_1|Tell me what my options are.
dlga_assassin_intro_0:close_window|I have no enemies I would wish this upon.
dlga_assassin_intro_1:assassin_intro_1_5|Very well, {reg33?Madam:Sir}. You can go about targeting an enemy lord in two ways. ^^ First, you can sponsor an attack on a lord by hiring a mercenary company. There is one in town right now that would prove suitable. This group would hunt down and attack your chosen lord, and they will pursue him to the ends of the earth. For example, if he is defeated by another, they will lie in wait until he regroups and attack again. Note that the lord needs to be in transit between centres before our troops can attack. The ususal fee for this service is in the region of ten thousand aurums.
dlga_assassin_intro_1_5:assassin_intro_2|Second, you can hire assassins to target that lord when he is away from his retinue. These men can be relied upon for their secrecy, though past attempts have shown that there is a high chance that the lord will fight them off. However, attacks which do succeed cause a lot of damage to a lord and his reputation. The target lord needs to own at least one fief, as that makes it easy for the assassins to lie in wait.^^ This service does not come cheap; the assassins usually command a fee of fifteen thousand aurums.
dlga_assassin_intro_2:target_lord_1|I'd like to target an enemy lord and his army.
dlga_assassin_intro_2:assassinate_lord_1|I'd like to order an assassination.
dlga_assassin_intro_2:close_window|I've changed my mind. This skulduggery is not for me.
dlga_target_lord_1:target_lord_2|By the way, it would be very foolish to target a king in this way, as you would lose the goodwill of both the people and the gentry if discovered, so I do not offer you that option.^^ The following lords all hold some enmity towards you. Which one would you like to target?
dlga_target_lord_2:target_lord_3|{s1}
dlga_target_lord_2:close_window|Never mind.
dlga_target_lord_3:close_window|I'm afraid the Kingdom does not have enough money to sponsor an attack.
dlga_target_lord_3:close_window.1|Very well. The Mercenaries are outside, preparing for their journey. My {reg33?lady:lord}, if you decide to follow them, please do so at a discreet distance. It would not do to have your name associated with this attack.

I once met a man named Shi Jin who was trying to warn people about them, but nobody listened to him.  And now the Zann are crushing our forces,and Shi Jin is probably the only one who know how to stop them.
dlga_tavern_traveler_tell_npc15_2:close_window|What kind of nonsense is this?

dlga_npc15_talk_0:npc15_talk_1|Stopping Zann won't be easy but it can be done. First of all, you need to understand that Jin Empire, whence Zann came, consists not only of original Jin lands, but also Khergia steppe, Sine land and Shun-Ha Island. The Emperor granted these lands to his vassals, but not all of them are truly loyal to him. Some of these traitors left with the Zann, but there are also a few cunning ones who pretend to serve the Emperor of Jin yet in fact support Zann from abroad.
dlga_npc15_talk_1:close_window|They are sending their armies to assist Zann invasion.These armies are The Horde of Jin, The Horde of Sine, The Horde of Shun Ha and The Horde of Khergia. If you defeat them, you will likely find the names of Jin lords who support Zann. Give these names to me, and I will send them to my uncle. And then I can guarantee you that you will no longer see these armies in Perisno.

dlga_adventurer_guildsman_talk:adventurer_taskgiver_failed|I failed the quest.
dlga_adventurer_guildsman_talk:end_quest_zannbaumeister|I found the person wearing strange black armor and did what was required.
dlga_end_quest_zannbaumeister:close_window|Good work.  I owe you a lot for helping me with this task.  That's your reward. But be careful. People over there are watching you. And I don't think their intentions are good. Farewell, {playername}.
dlga_adventurer_guildsman_talk_1:quest_zannbaumeister_1|Yes. I just happen to have a new client. He's a strange type though. I don't think I ever saw a black armor like the one he's wearing. Are you interested?
dlga_quest_zannbaumeister_1:close_window|No, thanks. Maybe next time.
dlga_quest_zannbaumeister_1:quest_zannbaumeister_2|Yes. Where is this client now?
dlga_quest_zannbaumeister_2:close_window|He is waiting in {s8}.
dlga_start:zannbaumeister_syabr_quest_victory_1|During my travels, I've learned some secrets of engineering. Also, Syabr is now in {s8}!
dlga_zannbaumeister_syabr_quest_victory_1:close_window|Take this tamga. If you show it to the Fort captain, he will let you recruit some of our troops from time to time.
dlga_start:close_window.20|Thank you for your help.
dlga_start:temnik_arslan_1|Are you that person who was looking for help? I was sent here by the Guild.
dlga_temnik_arslan_1:temnik_arslan_2|Yes. You see, my master ordered me to have a castle built for him with a pond in its yard. But there is a problem...
dlga_temnik_arslan_2:temnik_arslan_4|Wait. I am an adventurer, not a civilian engineer. I don't know how to build castles.
dlga_temnik_arslan_4:temnik_arslan_5|You don't need to. And if you had been patient enough to let me finish, you would have known that my master sent Syabr, a renowned fortification builder, to do this job. My role in this is merely making sure he has all the resources he needs. But now all my efforts will be pointless, because several days ago an escaped soldier from Syabr's escort arrived and said that they were ambushed by a large group of Mosoru riders. Syabr was taken prisoner by them and now I need someone to rescue him.
dlga_temnik_arslan_5:temnik_arslan_6|Don't you have troops for this? You don't look like a person who's experiencing a lack of soldiers at his disposal.
dlga_temnik_arslan_6:temnik_arslan_7|I certainly do. But I am no commander, nor a warrior, and I don't have anyone who could lead my soldiers in battle. So are you willing to take this job and rescue our engineer?
dlga_temnik_arslan_7:temnik_arslan_7_1|No. It is too dangerous for me.
dlga_temnik_arslan_7:temnik_arslan_7_2|I'd like to help you but I don't have enough troops for this ask.
dlga_temnik_arslan_7:temnik_arslan_7_3|Yes, I am ready to help.
dlga_temnik_arslan_7_1:close_window|That's alright. You are not the first coward who rejects this job after hearing the details.
dlga_temnik_arslan_7_2:close_window|This is not an issue. Actually, I have just bought some slaves from Ramun to work on castle construction. They will soon be escorted to our fort. Just follow them and when you arrive at the fort, find the captain and talk to him. Give him this letter, and he will give you some troops to help you on the task, as well as a scout who will lead you to the Mosoru.
dlga_temnik_arslan_7_3:close_window|Splendid. Then let us get to business. A group of slaves, that I have just bought Ramun to work on castle construction, will soon be escorted to our fort. Follow them, and after you arrive at the fort, find the captain and talk to him. Give him this letter, and he will have a scout lead you to the Mosoru.
dlga_start:close_window.21|Go to the Zann Outpost!
dlga_start:zann_prisoner_train_party_1|Who are you? What do you want?
dlga_zann_prisoner_train_party_1:zann_prisoner_train_party_2|I was sent here by Temnik Arslan. I need to get to Zann Outpost.
dlga_zann_prisoner_train_party_1:zann_prisoner_train_party_3|I'd like to search your carts.
dlga_zann_prisoner_train_party_1:close_window|Never mind!
dlga_zann_prisoner_train_party_2:close_window|Follow us then. We are just heading there
dlga_zann_prisoner_train_party_3:close_window|How dare you?! We are under protection of Emperor Zann Mandate of Heaven! Your foolish act will not be forgotten.
dlga_sol_introduce_3:talk_to_zann_fort_captain_1|I have come from Temnik Arslan (show the letter).
dlga_talk_to_zann_fort_captain_1:close_window|I see. I will have several troops and one of our scouts join your party and help you. Talk to the scout for the details on Mosuru's location
dlga_talk_to_zann_fort_captain_1:close_window.1|A scout joined your party. Talk to him.
dlga_regular_member_talk:dialogue_zann_ronin_1|Tell me what happened. Where was Syabr's party attacked?
dlga_dialogue_zann_ronin_1:dialogue_zann_ronin_2|They were moving across the desert from a dwarven town of {s8} to our outpost. That's when they were ambushed by the Mosoru.
dlga_dialogue_zann_ronin_2:dialogue_zann_ronin_3|What were they doing in Kaikoth lands?
dlga_dialogue_zann_ronin_3:dialogue_zann_ronin_4|Tower and bridge schematics for the future castle were designed by the famous Jin architect Gudu de lang. However it turned out that stone in these lands is not firm enough to hold the whole structures.
dlga_dialogue_zann_ronin_4:dialogue_zann_ronin_5|Go on...
dlga_dialogue_zann_ronin_5:dialogue_zann_ronin_6|So Syabr headed to the dwarven master Totigor to buy some components that are necessary for creating a sturdier compound.
dlga_dialogue_zann_ronin_6:dialogue_zann_ronin_7|All right. So where should we start looking for him?
dlga_dialogue_zann_ronin_7:dialogue_zann_ronin_8|I suggest that we head to the desert, find and capture one of Mosoru riders and ask him what he knows about the ambush and Syabr's current whereabouts.
dlga_dialogue_zann_ronin_8:close_window|Great. Then it's what we're going to do.
dlga_prisoner_chat_commoner:dialogue_mosoru_1|You! What do you know about a recent attack on the caravan that was carrying a cargo of construction materials?
dlga_dialogue_mosoru_1:dialogue_mosoru_end|What? I don't know nothing about it!
dlga_dialogue_mosoru_1:dialogue_mosoru_end.1|I have no idea what you are babbling about.
dlga_dialogue_mosoru_1:dialogue_mosoru_end.2|I've only heard that there was an attack on a caravan that turned out to be carrying some stone dust instead of gold and valuables.
dlga_dialogue_mosoru_1:dialogue_mosoru_2|I know that we suffered heavy losses yet only got a couple of prisoners and several bags of dust in the end.
dlga_dialogue_mosoru_end:prisoner_chat_release2|Fine. You are free to go.
dlga_dialogue_mosoru_2:dialogue_mosoru_3|Where did you get the prisoners?
dlga_dialogue_mosoru_3:dialogue_mosoru_4|As usual, we sold them into slavery to a tavern keeper in one of Hakkon towns.
dlga_dialogue_mosoru_4:dialogue_mosoru_5|What town was it?
dlga_dialogue_mosoru_5:dialogue_mosoru_6|{s8}.
dlga_dialogue_mosoru_6:prisoner_chat_release2|Fine. You are free to go.
dlga_tavernkeeper_talk:gesprach_town_19_tavernkeeper_1|So I've heard you were buying slaves...
dlga_gesprach_town_19_tavernkeeper_1:gesprach_town_19_tavernkeeper_2|Yes. But not for myself. It's just when one of this town's citizens need a slave, they come to me. Adventurers are also happy to get rid of prisoners they captured. Eventually it's a better option than dealing with those professional slave traders.
dlga_gesprach_town_19_tavernkeeper_2:gesprach_town_19_tavernkeeper_3|Have you recently bought anyone who was wearing an unusual armor?
dlga_gesprach_town_19_tavernkeeper_3:gesprach_town_19_tavernkeeper_4|And why should I answer this question?
dlga_gesprach_town_19_tavernkeeper_4:gesprach_town_19_tavernkeeper_5|I need this information. If you want, I can do a favor for you in return.
dlga_gesprach_town_19_tavernkeeper_5:gesprach_town_19_tavernkeeper_6|All right. I could use some help from a good soldier. You see, a group a Masnerian mercenaries had a fight in my tavern a couple of days ago. They broke a lot of stuff but didn't pay for it.
dlga_gesprach_town_19_tavernkeeper_6:gesprach_town_19_tavernkeeper_7|If somebody doesn't teach them a lesson, my other clients will also start to think they can do whatever they want in my tavern.
dlga_gesprach_town_19_tavernkeeper_7:gesprach_town_19_tavernkeeper_8|Do you need them dead or alive? Or just their gold?
dlga_gesprach_town_19_tavernkeeper_8:gesprach_town_19_tavernkeeper_9|I need them to pay. Whether they will end up dead or alive, does not really matter to me.
dlga_gesprach_town_19_tavernkeeper_9:gesprach_town_19_tavernkeeper_10|Fine. I'll do it. So for whom did you buy the slaves that were wearing a strange armor?
dlga_gesprach_town_19_tavernkeeper_10:gesprach_town_19_tavernkeeper_11|I think those Masnerian mercs were about to leave town soon. And it means that my money will leave with them.
dlga_gesprach_town_19_tavernkeeper_11:close_window|All right. You can consider them dead. I'll get back to you soon.
dlga_tavernkeeper_talk:gesprach_town_19_tavernkeeper_12_failed_quest|Those troublesome mercenaries are dealt with.
dlga_tavernkeeper_talk:gesprach_town_19_tavernkeeper_12_victory_quest|Those troublesome mercenaries are dealt with.
dlga_gesprach_town_19_tavernkeeper_12_failed_quest:gesprach_town_19_tavernkeeper_13_failed_quest|That's good. Except I have heard that it wasn't you who defeated them. Anyway, where are my 10000 aurums?
dlga_gesprach_town_19_tavernkeeper_12_victory_quest:gesprach_town_19_tavernkeeper_13_victory_quest|Great. Where are 1000 aurums that they owe me?
dlga_gesprach_town_19_tavernkeeper_13_failed_quest:gesprach_town_19_tavernkeeper_14|Here is the money.
dlga_gesprach_town_19_tavernkeeper_13_failed_quest:close_window|You'll have them. I'll get back to you soon.
dlga_gesprach_town_19_tavernkeeper_13_victory_quest:gesprach_town_19_tavernkeeper_14|Here is the money.
dlga_gesprach_town_19_tavernkeeper_13_victory_quest:close_window|You'll have them. I'll get back to you soon.
dlga_tavernkeeper_talk:gesprach_town_19_tavernkeeper_14|Here is the money.
dlga_gesprach_town_19_tavernkeeper_14:close_window|All right. A deal is a deal. Go and talk to our Guild Master. It was him I bought those slaves of yours for.
dlga_start:masnerian_mercenaries_dialogue_1|Who are you? What do you want?
dlga_masnerian_mercenaries_dialogue_1:battle_reason_stated|I'm here to make you pay your debt to the tavern keeper of {s8}.
dlga_mayor_talk:gesprach_town_19_mayor_1|I've heard that you recently bought some slaves and several of them were wearing strange black armor. Is that true?
dlga_gesprach_town_19_mayor_1:gesprach_town_19_mayor_2|Well, yes, I did buy several slaves. I needed them to work on reinforcing town walls.  And - yes, some of those slaves looked unusual, as if there were not from around here. And I can even tell you more - one of those slaves turned out to be quite a brilliant engineer. Thanks to his advice on multiple matters, we could finish in a week what we would otherwise have spent a month working on.
dlga_gesprach_town_19_mayor_2:gesprach_town_19_mayor_3|Why are working in reinforcing town walls? Shouldn't that be your lord's concern?
dlga_gesprach_town_19_mayor_3:gesprach_town_19_mayor_4|Out town was granted Magdeburg rights by the Emperor a long time ago. For the most of the time, we are making decisions on our own: what to produce, with whom to trade and so on. Justice here also lies in the hand of the court, not the town lord. Other than this, we paying taxes to the lord, while he is partially taking care of town's defenses.
dlga_gesprach_town_19_mayor_4:gesprach_town_19_mayor_5|Interesting. Anyway, I'm here because I want to buy that bay those slave including the engineer you were talking about.
dlga_gesprach_town_19_mayor_5:gesprach_town_19_mayor_6|Him? Hmm, I don't know if should even consider this. I haven't seen such a talent in a long time. But, well, if the price is right... let's say 30000 denars.
dlga_gesprach_town_19_mayor_6:vertrag_town_19_mayor_2|Here is your gold!
dlga_gesprach_town_19_mayor_6:gesprach_town_19_mayor_7|What? A fortune for a slave?
dlga_gesprach_town_19_mayor_7:gesprach_town_19_mayor_8|Yes. But... well, you could also do something for me.
dlga_gesprach_town_19_mayor_8:gesprach_town_19_mayor_9|Tell me what you need.
dlga_gesprach_town_19_mayor_9:gesprach_town_19_mayor_10|As I was saying, our lord is only partially responsible for town's defenses. Hence, about a half of our garrison should be comprised of local recruits. But most citizens have grown wealthy and like living their lives. They don't want to serve in the army.
dlga_gesprach_town_19_mayor_10:gesprach_town_19_mayor_11|Fine, why won't you hire mercenaries then?
dlga_gesprach_town_19_mayor_11:gesprach_town_19_mayor_12|This is just what I am about to do. People here collected 10000 denars to sign a contract with the Freelancer Guild, to hire their troops for our garrison and patrols.
dlga_gesprach_town_19_mayor_12:gesprach_town_19_mayor_13|What is this Freelancer Guild?
dlga_gesprach_town_19_mayor_13:gesprach_town_19_mayor_14|It is a mercenary guild from the west coast of Tolrania. Their base is located near a river, to the west from Enduin castle. Go there and ask freelancers to sign the contract. If you do it, the slaves will be yours. After all, I believe they will be done with the walls by the time you return.
dlga_gesprach_town_19_mayor_14:gesprach_town_19_mayor_15|All right. I'll do this. Give me the money you collected.
dlga_gesprach_town_19_mayor_15:close_window|He-he. No. First you have freelancers sign the contract, and then we will talk about the money.
dlga_auggie_buy_1:gesprach_augustus_1|I was sent here by the Guild Master of the town of {s8}. He wishes to sign a contract with your guild to hire freelancers for the town garrison as well as patrols.
dlga_gesprach_augustus_1:gesprach_augustus_2|That can be arranged. Did you bring 10000 aurums?
dlga_gesprach_augustus_2:gesprach_augustus_ende|Here is the money.
dlga_gesprach_augustus_2:close_window|Not yet. But I'll get back to you soon.
dlga_auggie_buy_1:gesprach_augustus_ende|Here is 10000 denars for the contract.
dlga_gesprach_augustus_2:gesprach_augustus_3|I'm running short of money these days. Maybe a person like me can do something for you instead?
dlga_gesprach_augustus_3:gesprach_augustus_4|Hmm. All right. A group of my freelancers deserted from an army that hired them having killed several fellow soldiers in the process. That seriously damaged our reputation, so I need to teach them a lesson. As far as I know, the last time they were spotted near {s7}. Deal with them, and the contract will be yours for only a half of the price.
dlga_gesprach_augustus_4:close_window|No, this task is too much for me. I'd rather bring you the money.
dlga_gesprach_augustus_4:close_window.1|I'll do it.
dlga_auggie_buy_1:gesprach_augustus_failed_quest|Group a freelancer deserters have been eliminated by another party.
dlga_gesprach_augustus_failed_quest:gesprach_augustus_2|This is also good. Did you bring 10000 aurums?
dlga_auggie_buy_1:gesprach_augustus_ende.1|Here is 5000 denars for the contract.
dlga_auggie_buy_1:gesprach_augustus_fertig_quest|Those troublesome deserters are dealt with.
dlga_gesprach_augustus_fertig_quest:gesprach_augustus_fertig_quest_1|This is good. Did you bring 5000 aurums?
dlga_gesprach_augustus_fertig_quest_1:gesprach_augustus_ende|Here is the money.
dlga_gesprach_augustus_fertig_quest_1:close_window|Not yet. But I'll get back to you soon.
dlga_auggie_buy_1:gesprach_augustus_ende.2|Here is 5000 denars for the contract.
dlga_gesprach_augustus_ende:gesprach_augustus_ende_1|So the contract is signed. The party of freelancers will soon head for {s8}.
dlga_gesprach_augustus_ende_1:close_window|See you later!

dlga_start:dialogue_freelancer_patrol_town_19_1|You are a threat to people of {s8}. Surrender or die!
dlga_dialogue_freelancer_patrol_town_19_1:close_window|What? You want a fight, so be it!
dlga_start:dialogue_freelancer_patrol_town_19_2|Who are you? What do you want?
dlga_dialogue_freelancer_patrol_town_19_2:close_window|Nothing.
dlga_dialogue_freelancer_patrol_town_19_2:battle_reason_stated|Surrender or die!
dlga_mayor_talk:vertrag_town_19_mayor_1|I signed the contract with freelancers. Now it's you turn. Give me the slaves and 10000 denars you owe me.
dlga_vertrag_town_19_mayor_1:vertrag_town_19_mayor_2|You probably misunderstood me. I'm giving you the slaves, as for money... well, let's say it's a compensation for the fact that I'm letting them keep their equipment.
dlga_vertrag_town_19_mayor_2:vertrag_town_19_mayor_3|Fine. Just let's get this over with.
dlga_vertrag_town_19_mayor_3:close_window|The engineer and his companions will be waiting for you at the town gate.

dlga_adventurer_guildsman_talk:meutererstadt_quest_victory|I found the client and did what was required.
dlga_meutererstadt_quest_victory:close_window|Good work.  That's your reward. But be careful. People over there are watching you. And I don't think their intentions are good.
dlga_adventurer_guildsman_talk_1:adventurer_m01_mem_s_nihonian_quest_1|Hello, {playername}. A lord came to our Guild recently, asking for help. Are you interested?

dlga_gesprach_mit_herr_town_7_1:gesprach_mit_herr_town_7_3|Oh, the problem is the citizens of {s8}, these ungrateful rebels. They keep supporting that Nibor Hood cutthroat. Even a part of town's garrison is practically on his side now, and I have to do something about it. My plan is to hire a team of loyal mercenaries to reinforce the garrison and watch for those traitors.
dlga_gesprach_mit_herr_town_7_3:close_window|I'm sorry, I'm not interested.
dlga_gesprach_mit_herr_town_7_3:gesprach_mit_herr_town_7_4|All right, I can help you with this. What kind mercenaries do you want to hire? 
dlga_gesprach_mit_herr_town_7_4:close_window|Outlanders. Those who do not share locals' beliefs and views. I think somebody like Nihonian mercenaries will do. Find them and persuade them to work for me. 
dlga_mercenary_tavern_talk:gesprach_mit_m01_mem_s_nihonian_1|One of local lords is looking for mercenaries to serve in his town's garrison. Are you interested?
dlga_gesprach_mit_m01_mem_s_nihonian_1:close_window|Well, we don't know anything about you, let alone this lord. But money could solve this problem. Hire us, and then we can talk.
dlga_regular_member_talk:dialogue_m01_mem_s_nihonian_1|You have your money. So what about garrison service I mentioned? 
dlga_dialogue_m01_mem_s_nihonian_1:close_window|This is a good offer, but there are too few of us here.  However, a large party of my friends along with their chieftain Omelian Kasap were hired to get rid of a band of brigands robbing people near {s9}.  They are probably at the castle at this moment. Go and talk to them. 
dlga_start:gesprech_mit_omelian_kasap_1|Greetings, {s9}! My name is {playername}. I came with an offer for you and your men.
dlga_gesprech_mit_omelian_kasap_1:gesprech_mit_omelian_kasap_2|Speak then. What is it? 
dlga_gesprech_mit_omelian_kasap_2:gesprech_mit_omelian_kasap_3|A lord who owns {s8} wants you to serve in the garrison of his town. Money will not be a problem, but you will need to watch for other soldiers and ensure their loyalty to the lord. 
dlga_gesprech_mit_omelian_kasap_3:close_window|Hmm. This is a fine offer for an old man such as I. Speaking frankly, I've gotten  tired of traveling, and the garrison duty is what I probably need now. In other words, I agree. I'll see you outside castle walls.
dlga_start:close_window.24|We can cover the rest of the way on our own. Thanks.

dlga_gesprach_mit_omelian_kasap_party_2:gesprach_mit_omelian_kasap_party_3|I have a plan. First I and my people enter the town claiming that we came to join Nibor Hood. Then after the gates are open, it's your turn. We will only be able to hold the gates for a short time, so hurry!

dlga_start:elderly_amazon_intro_1|Greetings. You must be my escort, right?
dlga_elderly_amazon_intro_1:elderly_amazon_intro_2|What? ... Yes, I suppose so. My name is {playername}. I was told you were looking for help.
dlga_elderly_amazon_intro_2:elderly_amazon_intro_2_1|That is true. My name is Oksanamunmun. You need to know what you are about to sign up for, so let me tell you my story.
dlga_elderly_amazon_intro_2_1:elderly_amazon_intro_3|I used to have a daughter who was unfortunate to give birth to a boy. The Amazon Priestesses ordered her to sacrifice him to the gods so that they will help us in our fights against Tolranian lords...
dlga_elderly_amazon_intro_3:elderly_amazon_intro_4|That's barbaric!
dlga_elderly_amazon_intro_4:elderly_amazon_intro_5|... My daughter escaped and left the child with me. When she returned, she was executed. This made me change my mind about life. I ran away and took my grandson with me.
dlga_elderly_amazon_intro_5:elderly_amazon_intro_6|And now you are planning to begin a new life?
dlga_elderly_amazon_intro_6:elderly_amazon_intro_7|Yes. I want to go to the town of free people where residents do not pay attention to one's sex or origins.
dlga_elderly_amazon_intro_7:elderly_amazon_intro_8|Is there such town in Perisno?
dlga_elderly_amazon_intro_8:elderly_amazon_intro_9|There is! It is called Fountain Hall. But I have a problem. The Priestess' cadres are now hunting us. I took refuge in this city. Now I am looking for someone to escort me to my destination. Are you up to this task?
dlga_elderly_amazon_intro_9:escort_elderly_amazon_talk|I am! I will lead you to Fountain Hall.
dlga_start:escort_elderly_amazon_talk|Eh. We've made it this far... What do you want me to do?
dlga_escort_elderly_amazon_talk:elderly_amazon_follow_lead|You follow my lead. I'll take you through a safe route.
dlga_elderly_amazon_follow_lead:close_window|Alright. I'll be right behind you.
dlga_escort_elderly_amazon_talk:elderly_amazon_stay_here|You stay here for a while. I'll go ahead and check the road.
dlga_elderly_amazon_stay_here:close_window|Alright. I'll be waiting here for you.
dlga_start:dialog_mit_persecutors_elderly_amazon_variante_1|Hey, you! Don't move! Surrender the old traitor to us, and then we will let you go!
dlga_dialog_mit_persecutors_elderly_amazon_variante_1:battle_reason_stated|No! (clears throat)... And you should rather get married! Maybe then you will stop being so afraid of men!
dlga_start:dialog_mit_persecutors_elderly_amazon_variante_2|(Angrily) Get me the traitor! Alive!
dlga_dialog_mit_persecutors_elderly_amazon_variante_2:dialog_mit_persecutors_elderly_amazon_variante_2_1|Hold on, ladies! Where are your manners? It's no good to attack people without even saying Hello!
dlga_dialog_mit_persecutors_elderly_amazon_variante_2_1:battle_reason_stated|Get me this piece of shit too! The Priestess will cut out {reg33?her:his} tongue!
dlga_start:dialog_mit_persecutors_elderly_amazon_variante_3|Where did the old hag and her grandson hide?
dlga_dialog_mit_persecutors_elderly_amazon_variante_3:battle_reason_stated|Gods, you are stubborn! Stay away from me!
dlga_tavern_traveler_talk:tavern_traveler_tell_elderly_amazon_1|What's new?
dlga_tavern_traveler_tell_elderly_amazon_1:tavern_traveler_tell_elderly_amazon_2|The elderly amazon is looking for you. I saw her at the tavern of {s8}.
dlga_tavern_traveler_tell_elderly_amazon_2:close_window|I don't want to see this liar.
dlga_tavern_traveler_tell_elderly_amazon_2:close_window.1|Thank you for telling me! I'll talk to her.
dlga_start:talk_elderly_amazon_1|Greetings, {playername}. I couldn't pay you for your help back then but I can now.
dlga_talk_elderly_amazon_1:talk_elderly_amazon_2|Thanks!
dlga_talk_elderly_amazon_2:talk_elderly_amazon_3|I managed to do quite well in this town. I'm not short of money anymore, my grandson is safe, but my daughter ... My heart is longing for revenge. I saved some gold and hired a couple of mercenaries, but I cannot leave my grandchild. He needs nurture and protection. So now I am looking for someone who would avenge my daughter's death for me.
dlga_talk_elderly_amazon_3:close_window|No, not interested
dlga_talk_elderly_amazon_3:talk_elderly_amazon_4|Well, those ladies don't like me anyway. Do you know where they are to be found?
dlga_talk_elderly_amazon_4:close_window|No, but captain Berkut is trying to find the murderer of my daughter. From time to time he visits the tavern of Lille. Can you find him there and talk to him?
dlga_start:close_window.27|Go to the town of Lille!
dlga_start:captain_berkut_1|Greetings, {s9}! My name is {playername}. I was sent here to help you. You and your soldiers have been placed at my disposal.
dlga_captain_berkut_1:captain_berkut_2|Yes, {reg33?madame:sir}!
dlga_captain_berkut_2:captain_berkut_3|How is your investigation doing?
dlga_captain_berkut_3:captain_berkut_4|I sent my men to gather information, and they found out that the elves of this town are supporting the Ankars.
dlga_captain_berkut_4:captain_berkut_5|From time to time they would send a caravan of goods guarded by female soldiers. I believe such caravans go to Ankars.
dlga_captain_berkut_5:captain_berkut_6|In my opinion you should start by finding out what exactly those caravans carry.
dlga_captain_berkut_6:captain_berkut_7|Good work, captain! When does the next caravan leave the  town?
dlga_captain_berkut_7:captain_berkut_8|Very soon.
dlga_captain_berkut_8:close_window|Good. I'll deal with the caravan, and you stay here and gather your men.
dlga_start:ankars_caravan_1|Who are you? What do you want?
dlga_ankars_caravan_1:ankars_caravan_2|I'd like to search your carts.
dlga_ankars_caravan_2:battle_reason_stated|How dare you?! We are under protection of Queen Arwen! Your foolish act will not be forgotten.
dlga_start:captain_berkut_9|{reg33?Madame:Sir}
dlga_captain_berkut_9:close_window|Stay here and gather your men.
dlga_captain_berkut_9:captain_berkutr_failed|Unfortunately, I couldn't search the caravan.
dlga_start:close_window.28|Stay here and gather your men.
dlga_start:close_window.29|Stay here and gather your men.
dlga_start:captain_berkutr_failed|Unfortunately, I couldn't search the caravan.
dlga_captain_berkutr_failed:close_window|That is bad. However, another caravan left the town about an hour ago. You can try and catch this one.
dlga_start:defeat_ankars_caravan_1|Caravan guards refused to show me their goods voluntarily, so I had to search the caravan by force. It was carrying bows and arrows.
dlga_defeat_ankars_caravan_1:defeat_ankars_caravan_2|Good work.
dlga_defeat_ankars_caravan_2:defeat_ankars_caravan_3|So, what do we do now?
dlga_defeat_ankars_caravan_3:defeat_ankars_caravan_4|I think I have to tell Oksanamun about that. You and your men should stay here.
dlga_defeat_ankars_caravan_4:close_window|Yes, {reg33?madame:sir}. But be careful. People over there are watching you. And I don't think their intentions are good.
dlga_start:report_elderly_amazon_1|Greetings, {playername}. What news do you bring?
dlga_report_elderly_amazon_1:report_elderly_amazon_2|I intercepted a caravan that departed from the town of Lille. It was carrying amazon bows and arrows.
dlga_report_elderly_amazon_2:report_elderly_amazon_3|Good! Amazons do not produce weapons on their own. Instead they maintain good relationship with the elves. Elves deliver supplies. Amazons pay with gold or slaves, protect trade routes and do other things in return.
dlga_report_elderly_amazon_3:report_elderly_amazon_4|Now you have to keep looking in this direction.
dlga_report_elderly_amazon_4:report_elderly_amazon_5|Find amazons who are waiting for caravans from Lille. Talk to captain Berkut about that.
dlga_report_elderly_amazon_5:report_elderly_amazon_6|After you defeat them, let someone live and tell them to tell the others that it was my revenge. Tell them that I will not stop until their priestesses come to me. I am sure that the queen will not risk jeopardizing trade with the elves and therefore will fulfill my demand.
dlga_report_elderly_amazon_6:report_elderly_amazon_7|Fine. I'll do as you say.
dlga_report_elderly_amazon_7:close_window|Be careful.
dlga_start:close_window.30|Go to the town of Lille!
dlga_start:captain_berkut_10|{reg33?Madame:Sir}
dlga_captain_berkut_10:captain_berkut_11|I need to find out where caravans are heading.
dlga_captain_berkut_11:captain_berkut_12|Good. One of the caravans left about an hour age.
dlga_captain_berkut_12:captain_berkut_13|I'll follow it. You and men have to join me.
dlga_captain_berkut_13:close_window|Yes, {reg33?madame:sir}!
dlga_start:defeat_squad_amazon_1|I did what you asked. I found the party of amazons waiting for the goods and defeated them.
dlga_defeat_squad_amazon_1:close_window|Good work. Thank you!

dlga_adventurer_guildsman_talk:killed_joan_zwiebel|I found Joan Zwiebel's army, defeated and killed her!
dlga_killed_joan_zwiebel:close_window|Good work.  I owe you a lot for helping me with this task. Farewell, {playername}.
dlga_adventurer_guildsman_talk_1:adventurer_joan_zwiebel_quest_1|It is great to see you, {playername}. I have a problem. Some time ago, a mysterious stranger came to me. He gave The Guild a dangerous assignments which I was foolish enough to accept.
dlga_adventurer_joan_zwiebel_quest_1:adventurer_joan_zwiebel_quest_2|Back then I did not quite realize how difficult it would be to fulfill it. So now I am asking for you help. Are you up to a challenge?

dlga_adventurer_joan_zwiebel_quest_3:adventurer_joan_zwiebel_quest_4|Great! It's about getting rid of someone... a woman.
dlga_adventurer_joan_zwiebel_quest_4:adventurer_joan_zwiebel_quest_5|How is this difficult? You could just hire a couple of Ral'Daiun assassins.
dlga_adventurer_joan_zwiebel_quest_5:adventurer_joan_zwiebel_quest_6|They already made five attempts but haven't been successful. The name of the woman is Joan Zwiebel.
dlga_adventurer_joan_zwiebel_quest_6:adventurer_joan_zwiebel_quest_7|Well, I suppose the assassins just couldn't stand against her beauty (smiling).
dlga_adventurer_joan_zwiebel_quest_7:adventurer_joan_zwiebel_quest_8|It's not about that. Joan Zwiebel was leading militia during the War of the Woods. Now she is very popular. A lot of people support her, even more than they would support their own king.
dlga_adventurer_joan_zwiebel_quest_8:adventurer_joan_zwiebel_quest_9|Really?!
dlga_adventurer_joan_zwiebel_quest_9:adventurer_joan_zwiebel_quest_10|Yes. And I am actually inclined to believe that this 'Mysterious Stranger' was the Tolranian Spymaster.
dlga_adventurer_joan_zwiebel_quest_10:adventurer_joan_zwiebel_quest_11|So this is all about politics. And now I either have to cooperate and kill that woman or die because of knowing too much.

dlga_a_guild_intro:a_guild_intro_1|I am glad you asked! We are a group of men and women dedicated to getting beginning adventurers started on their journeys to become famous. We give out tasks, quests, and jobs of all sorts to people who want it and if those in need request a favor we will try to send an Adventurer to help them. Of course, we require payment from the ones who request help from us.
dlga_a_guild_intro_1:a_guild_intro_2|So basically you guys are a group of people that send your guildsman to help those in need, if paid?
dlga_a_guild_intro_2:a_guild_talk|Essentially, yes. Although we occasionally send mercenaries to help as well. It is a very fair system, I think. Pay us to help you, and we will pay mercenaries or our guildsman to go help. That way, everyone ends up happy. Are you looking for any tasks to complete, adventurer?
dlga_a_guild_talk:a_guild_task_1|I am a mercenary in these lands. I indeed would like to complete some quests.
dlga_a_guild_talk:close_window|No. Goodbye for now.
dlga_a_guild_task_1:a_guild_task_1a|I was hoping you would ask. I don't know how capable you are, but since you are new, I will give you an easier job. Recently, we were contacted by an anonymous village elder who told us that a group of rebel peasants - around 10 or 20 have rioted and escaped from the village. They are now fugitives, and are told to be around this town. We want you to hunt these peasants down and defeat them, then take their money that they stole from the village elder and give it to us so we can return it to the elder.

dlga_fight2:fight3|What a bunch of fools! I thought you would at least prove a challenge of some sort. I have come to kill you and take back your money that you stole from your village's treasuries.
dlga_fight3:close_window|Men ... steady! We shall let no one get in our way of freedom!
dlga_start:ag_taskgiver_talk|Yes?
dlga_ag_taskgiver_talk:ag_taskgiver_quest|Do you have any tasks for me?
dlga_ag_taskgiver_quest:ag_quest_elf|Actually, yes. A while ago, a mysterious stranger approached me, telling me to look out for any adventurer who was up for a hard task, and giving me a chest of gold as a reward for the one who would complete it. Might you be up for it?
dlga_ag_quest_elf:ag_quest_elf1|I don't see why not.
dlga_ag_quest_elf1:ag_quest_elf2|It's about getting rid of someone...a woman.
dlga_ag_quest_elf2:ag_quest_elf3|How is this difficult? You could hire some of Ral D'Aiun's assassins.
dlga_ag_quest_elf3:ag_quest_elf4|They already made five attempts but haven't been successfull. The name of that woman is Nadriela Zwiebel - an Elvarie.
dlga_ag_quest_elf4:ag_quest_elf5|Umm... am I supposed to know that name?
dlga_ag_quest_elf5:ag_quest_elf6|It might ring a bell. Nadriela was the leader of a contingent of rangers back in the War of the Woods. She is very famous - a legend among the Elvarie and Tolranians. I was told that she killed the son of the Tolranian spymaster in a skirmish, which made him hate her.
dlga_ag_quest_elf6:ag_quest_elf7|So you want me to get rid of her?
dlga_ag_quest_elf7:ag_quest_elf8|Yes. However, the Tolranian Spymaster is also hunting her, so you must be careful. I had specific instructions that the Spymaster must not be the one to kill her. I do not know why this is, but the person made it seem vital.
dlga_ag_quest_elf8:ag_quest_elf9|Okay. Do you know where Nadriela is right now?
dlga_ag_quest_elf9:close_window|The person told me that she would be near Elsinore. Good luck, adventurer.
dlga_ag_quest_elf:close_window|No thanks.
dlga_ag_taskgiver_quest:close_window|There are no more quests available for you right now. Come back to me later.
dlga_ag_taskgiver_talk:ag_taskgiver_ask|Who are adventurer's guild again?
dlga_ag_taskgiver_ask:ag_taskgiver_ask_finish|I am glad you asked! We are a group of men and women dedicated to getting beginning adventurers started on their journeys to become famous. We give out tasks, quests, and jobs of all sorts to people who want it and if those in need request a favor we will try to send an Adventurer to help them. Of course, we require payment from the ones who request help from us.
dlga_ag_taskgiver_ask_finish:ag_taskgiver_talk|Ah, yes. Thanks for clearing that up for me.
dlga_ag_taskgiver_talk:ag_taskgiver_talk|Nevermind.
dlga_start:ulthidir_hello|Greetings, {playername}.
dlga_ulthidir_hello:ulthidir_info_0|Can you tell me a bit about yourself?
dlga_ulthidir_hello:close_window|I need to be going now. Farewell.
dlga_start:ulthidir_failed|I have not managed to defeat Kalrind. I am sorry.
dlga_ulthidir_failed:close_window|Oh well. I guess I will need someone else to do it, then. I am glad that you were not killed - Kalrind is tough! Good luck, {playername}.
dlga_start:victory1.1|I have defeated Kalrind!
dlga_victory1:close_window.1|Congradulations, {playername}. You have done the kingdom of Elintor - and me a huge favor! Here is your reward.
dlga_start:i_am_ulthidir_0|Greetings. Who might you be?
dlga_i_am_ulthidir_0:ulthidir_talk|Me? I am Ulthidir, a minor noble of the Elintoran Nation. What is it you need?
dlga_ulthidir_talk:ulthidir_info_0|I am {playername}. Can you tell me a bit more about yourself?
dlga_ulthidir_info_0:ulthidir_info_1|I fought in the battle of Lille's Claw, a few years back, young {reg33?Lady:Squire}. We were fighting against a large army of the Tolranian bastards, and we held them off in the pass known as Lille's Claw. The foolish Kingsmen of the Tolranians had no shields, making them easy targets for our archers as we rained death upon our enemies. It was a good day, a day of victory and glory. I also avenged my father that day, who died in the War of the Woods. The damned Tolranians have grown too arrogant, and had forgotten how our bows can easily pierce their armor. Perhaps it is time for all of us to rally again, to drive the Tolranians entirely out of their lands. Many of us hope...
dlga_ulthidir_info_1:close_window|I see. Very interesting. Goodbye.
dlga_ulthidir_talk:ulthidir_task|Do you have any tasks for me?
dlga_ulthidir_task:ulthidir_task_1|Now that you ask, yes. I am a minor noble, and I own a small amount of land near the Geldarin forests. A word of advice, friend. When offered an estate near Geldarin territory, politely decline. I chose to govern it, and now every single day I am plagued by the damn Geldarin elves. There has been one group, in specific, causing more trouble than the others.
dlga_ulthidir_task_1:ulthidir_task_2|I'm guessing you want me to take care of them?
dlga_ulthidir_task_2:ulthidir_task_3|Yes. However, these are not your ordinary group of Geldarin Elves. They are led by one of their nobles, Kalrind. He has an infamous reputation for massacring Elvarie and Humans alike. Beware of him, when you fight him. He will not be taken down easily. 
dlga_ulthidir_task_3:ulthidir_task_4|Where do I find him?
dlga_ulthidir_task_4:close_window|You will find him in the Geldarin forests. Good luck, {playername}.
dlga_ulthidir_task_3:close_window|Nevermind, then. I have other things to attend to first.
dlga_ulthidir_talk:close_window|Nothing. Farewell.
dlga_start:fight2.1|Who are you?.
dlga_fight2:fight3.1|Me? I am {playername}, and I have come to kill you!
dlga_fight3:close_window.1|Have you, now? Well, let's see about that!
dlga_start:close_window.34|I am going to find Kunika now.
dlga_start:thanks11|Ah, good for you to come. Now, you have done us a great service, defeating Kunika. I believe, before we move on to other affairs, that that will need to be addressed. Here is your reward.
dlga_thanks11:thanks12|Thank you. Now, I have a question. Why were you following me?
dlga_thanks12:thanks13|Well - no offense, but I could not trust you - a mercenary to fight Kunika. I wanted to see what would happen once you fought him.
dlga_thanks13:thanks14|So I was simply bait?
dlga_thanks14:thanks15|Yes, unfortunately. However, I trust you now, and all the dragon priests are grateful for you. I have a request, if I may.
dlga_thanks15:thanks16|What is it?
dlga_thanks16:thanks17|I would like to join your party as a companion. My life has been terrible here, as a dragon priest, and I want to take a long break and explore the world. Will you take me?
dlga_thanks17:companion_khivachis|Of course! Pack your belongings, then, if you are joining, and meet me outside the town walls. I am honored by your offer.
dlga_thanks17:close_window|No, I'm sorry. I cannot take you. Goodbye.
dlga_companion_khivachis:close_window|Thank you, {playername}. I shall prepare at once.
dlga_start:close_window.35|I shall prepare at once.
dlga_start:kill_kunika|{playername}, my scouts have discovered the location of the leader of the Sectarian Priests, Kunika. They say he is somewhere near Reichberg. I want your final task to be to find him and defeat him.
dlga_kill_kunika:kill_kunika21|Hmm. That is a lot to ask for. He will undoubtably be strong and have a huge army. How much will I be paid?
dlga_kill_kunika21:kunika32|You will be paid 15,000 aurums and you will forever have the gratitude of the Priests of the Dragon. I shall also reward you with a Wyvern mount.
dlga_kunika32:kunika212|I shall do it.
dlga_kunika212:close_window|Good luck, {playername}.
dlga_kunika32:close_window|I will need time to prepare for this.
dlga_start:skunika|You have been causing much grief to us, fool. You have no idea who you are messing with.
dlga_skunika:skunika12|I'm guessing you are Kunika? How stupid of you to come to me when I was looking for you!
dlga_skunika12:close_window|I will crush you and end your little life. We will become the new Dragon order.
dlga_start:task_hunt_secretarians|Hello again, {playername}. I assume you have come back to hear your next task?
dlga_task_hunt_secretarians:task_hunt_secretarians1|Yes.
dlga_task_hunt_secretarians:close_window|No, I'm a bit busy right now.
dlga_task_hunt_secretarians1:task_hunt_secretarians2|Very well. My scouts have reported that the Sectarians are amassing in large numbers, and they have been sending scouts near Drachen lands. I would like you to hunt them down. I will pay you 1500 aurums for each group you destroy, and come back once you have defeated at least five groups.
dlga_task_hunt_secretarians2:task_hunt_secretarians3|I will begin immediately.
dlga_task_hunt_secretarians3:close_window|Good luck.
dlga_start:priestess_talk|Yes? Have you made progress?
dlga_priestess_talk:close_window|Not yet. Goodbye.
dlga_priestess_talk:secretarian_payment|I have hunted down some Sectarian Scouts.
dlga_secretarian_payment:secretarian_payment_2|Yes, my scouts have informed me.    The reward is 1500 aurums for every Sectarian party. Here is your money, as promised.
dlga_secretarian_payment_3:secretarian_reward|You certainly deserved your pay. Most of the Sectarian scouting parties have been dealt with and now they won't be getting so many intelligence reports. They will not anticipate us now. You have done an excellent job.
dlga_secretarian_reward:secretarian_reward_2|Thank you. Is there any other job for me?
dlga_secretarian_reward_2:close_window|Yes, I will have a job for you later.
dlga_secretarian_payment_3:close_window|Continue hunting them, {playername}. Good luck.
dlga_secretarian_payment_2:secretarian_payment_3|Thank you.
dlga_start:close_window.36|I will escort them now to Voldeberg.
dlga_start:priestess_succeeded|I have succeeded in escorting the wyverns to Voldeberg.
dlga_priestess_succeeded:priestess_succeeded1|That is good to hear! One of my contacts in Voldeberg told me about you success. You didn't happen to be attacked by any Sectarian priests, did you?
dlga_priestess_succeeded1:priestess_succeeded2|Actually, we were ambushed by them. We fought them off, however. 
dlga_priestess_succeeded2:priestess_succeeded3|The Sectarian priests are growing stronger by the day. I fear they may do something drastic soon.
dlga_priestess_succeeded3:priestess_succeeded4|Is there anything else I can do to help you fight them?.
dlga_priestess_succeeded4:close_window|I will have a job for you later so come back once you are ready.
dlga_start:priestess_failed|I have failed. I'm sorry.
dlga_priestess_failed:close_window|I am disappointed. I thought better of you, {playername}, but apparently you cannot be trusted.
dlga_start:close_window.37|Nevermind.
dlga_start:priestess_1|Who are you, fool? Why have you come to me without kneeling?
dlga_priestess_1:priestess_2|I am {playername}. My apologies, my Lady, I am unaware of your customs. If I may ask, who are you?
dlga_priestess_2:priestess_3|Very well. I am Khivachis, one of the three High Priestesses of the Dragon in the Reich des Drachen. High Drachen Priestess Amara is my twin sister. My question still stands. Why have you come to me? 
dlga_priestess_3:priestess_4|My Lady, I have come seeking adventure. Might you have a task for me?
dlga_priestess_3:close_window|I don't know. Goodbye.
dlga_priestess_1:close_window|Someone unimportant. Goodbye.
dlga_priestess_4:priestess_quest_1|A task? Why, yes. I was just thinking about this earlier. I need a capable band of mercenaries to escort a group of my Wyvern Riders to {s8}. They are on a mission to deliver a letter to the Baron there, and they must reach their destination. Could you possibly lend a hand on this?
dlga_priestess_quest_1:priestess_quest_2|Sure. But I have some questions. First, why are you trusting me to such an important task already, and second, can't the Wyvern Riders defend themselves? I have heard they are fearsome fighters, along with their mounts.
dlga_priestess_quest_2:priestess_quest_3|Why am I trusting you? Well, you don't look like a spy or someone who is working for our enemies, and know that I can summon the wrath of the entire Reich and all of our dragons and dragon riders to destroy you. The Wyvern Riders can defend themselves well enough, but ... recently we have heard reports that our enemies, the Sectarian Dragon Priests, are getting stronger. We can't risk losing valuable wyverns to them.
dlga_priestess_quest_3:priestess_quest_4|Very well. I will escort them for you.
dlga_priestess_quest_3:close_window|Nevermind. I am too busy right now. Sorry!
dlga_priestess_quest_4:close_window|Perfect. The Wyvern riders will wait outside the town for you.
dlga_priestess_quest_4:close_window.1|I am afraid I don't have that many soldiers with me.
dlga_priestess_quest_4:close_window.2|Sorry. I can't do that right now
dlga_start:close_window.38|We can cover the rest of the way ourselves. Thanks.
dlga_start:close_window.39| Well, we have almost reached {s21}. We can cover the rest of the way ourselves. Thanks for escorting us. Good luck.
dlga_start:wyvern_riders_intro_1|Greetings. You must be our escort, right?
dlga_wyvern_riders_intro_1:wyvern_riders_intro_2|Yes. My name is {playername}. I will lead you to {s1}.
dlga_wyvern_riders_intro_2:escort_wyverns_talk|Well, It is good to know we won't travel alone. What do you want us to do now?
dlga_start:escort_wyverns_talk|Eh. We've made it this far... What do you want us to do?
dlga_escort_wyverns_talk:wyvern_riders_follow_lead|You follow my lead. I'll take you through a safe route.
dlga_wyvern_riders_follow_lead:close_window|Alright. We'll be right behind you.
dlga_escort_wyverns_talk:wyvern_riders_stay_here|You stay here for a while. I'll go ahead and check the road.
dlga_wyvern_riders_stay_here:close_window|Alright. We'll be waiting here for you.
dlga_start:ssambus1|Well hello, traveler. What have you got with you?
dlga_ssambus1:ssambus2|And who are you to ask that?
dlga_ssambus2:ssambus3|Who am I? I am a dragon priest - a true dragon priest. I see you have some of your wyverm friends with you.
dlga_ssambus3:ssambus4|What I do is none of your business.
dlga_ssambus4:ssambus5|No need for rude words, fellow traveler. Better hand over your money and let us deal with the wyvern riders, now.
dlga_ssambus5:ssambus6|I will pass, thank you. Instead I think you should hand ME your money instead.
dlga_ssambus6:close_window|I had hoped you would be reasonable, but oh well. They're all the same ...
dlga_start:close_window.40|Greetings. We are travelling to our destination. 
dlga_start:shadesin_intro|What is it you want?
dlga_shadesin_intro:shadesin_intro1|I wish to join you and become a Demon Worshipper.
dlga_shadesin_intro:close_window|Nothing.
dlga_start:close_window.41|Away with you, vile heretic. Those who oppose our kind shall taste the wrath of the Dreaded One. [Placeholder NPC until future versions]
dlga_shadesin_intro1:shadesin_intro2|Ha! You think  it is that simple? If you truly wish to become one of us, you must prove that you are not some filthy spy from the Church of Faith.
dlga_shadesin_intro2:shadesin_intro3|How do I do that?
dlga_shadesin_intro3:shadesin_intro4|You must go on a pilgrimage to our Demon Shrine, and see if the Priests there will accept you. Before you do that, you must give me 1500 aurums. Our treasury is growing thin. Show your dedication in this way.
dlga_shadesin_intro4:quest_accepted_1|Very well. I shall travel to the Shrine and pay my respects to the Demon Gods and the Dreaded One.
dlga_shadesin_intro4:close_window|No thanks, then.
dlga_quest_accepted_1:close_window|Good. I shall await your return... or not, if the Demon Priests find you unworthy.
dlga_start:demon_priest_intro|Greetings, stranger. Why have you come here, to the holiest of our shrines? Have you come with a demand, or perhaps an offer? Either way, you will not be allowed to leave until you state exactly what you want here.
dlga_demon_priest_intro:demon_priest_intro1|I have come to join your Order and religion. I believe in your beliefs, and I will do anything it takes to prove it. Shadesin sent me here. I have already paid him 1500 aurums in advance.
dlga_demon_priest_intro1:demon_priest_intro2|You think it is that easy? You will have to prove yourself. I will bestow the rank of Demon Pilgrin upon you for now. Talk to Shadesin again. You must prove yourself as worthy before you can become a full member, or learn any of our secrets. Leave me now.
dlga_demon_priest_intro2:close_window|Thank you, my Lord. I will serve our Order well.
dlga_start:third_merchant_buy|Good day, would you like to have a look at my wares?
dlga_third_merchant_buy:third_merchant_window|Yes, let me see what you have for sale.
dlga_third_merchant_buy:close_window|No, thanks.
dlga_third_merchant_window:close_window|Thank you for your business.
dlga_start:marshal1|Good day, {reg33?madame:sir}. It is an honor to meet the {reg33?lady:man} that rid us of the oppresive Atanos Octiem. You can buy all kinds of Legion troops from me.
dlga_marshal1:marshal2|Excellent. Let's see what you have.
dlga_marshal1:close_window|I don't need any soldiers right now.
dlga_marshal2:marshal3|Let me know what you're interested in.
dlga_marshal3:marshal4|Companion Infantry.
dlga_marshal3:marshal4.1|Companion Archers.
dlga_marshal3:marshal4.2|Companion Cavalry.
dlga_marshal3:marshal4.3|Legionaries.
dlga_marshal3:marshal4.4|Atanon Guards.
dlga_marshal3:close_window|Nevermind.
dlga_marshal4:marshal5|Hmm, let me see...
dlga_marshal5:marshal6|I can get you those for a price of {s4} aurums each. How many would you like?
dlga_marshal6:marshal_end_5|1
dlga_marshal6:marshal_end_5.1|5
dlga_marshal6:marshal_end_5.2|10
dlga_marshal6:marshal_end_5.3|20
dlga_marshal6:marshal_end_5.4|50
dlga_marshal6:close_window|That is too expensive.
dlga_marshal6:marshal2|Let me reconsider.
dlga_marshal_end_5:close_window|They are all at your service, {playername}
dlga_start:marshal_buy_1|Glad to see you again, {playername}. Have you come for more Legion troops?
dlga_marshal_buy_1:marshal2|Indeed.
dlga_marshal_buy_1:close_window|No thanks, I have to go.
dlga_start:austad_talk17|...I...I can hardly believe it!
dlga_start:close_window.42|We'll meet you outside the fort.
dlga_start:austad_talk15|Well? Have you made a decision?
dlga_start:austad_talk1|...Hmm? What are you looking at, soldier?
dlga_austad_talk1:austad_talk2|Sir, I was just wondering why you're back here in the residential district.
dlga_austad_talk1:close_window|Forgive me, Visavo.
dlga_austad_talk2:austad_talk3|And why should the business of a Visavo concern a legionary like yourself?
dlga_austad_talk3:austad_talk4|A man of your rank just seems out of place here, that's all.
dlga_austad_talk3:close_window|You're right, sir. I should move along.
dlga_austad_talk4:austad_talk5|Hmm...say, your accent sounds quite odd for a {reg33?woman:man} of the Third. Who is your Visavo?
dlga_austad_talk5:austad_talk6|Uh...Visavo...Oct...uh...Oct-Octervius?
dlga_austad_talk6:austad_talk7|Who? You don't even kn- hold on. Your uniform looks off as well. You're not a real Third soldier, are you!
dlga_austad_talk7:austad_talk8|You know, I should probably get back to my post-
dlga_austad_talk8:austad_talk9|Wait, soldier, your face looks awfully familiar...you're the renowned {reg33?lady:lord} {playername}, aren't you? You've caused quite a stir in the lands of Perisno lately.
dlga_austad_talk8:close_window|(Looks puzzled) Very well...soldier. [Not enough renown]
dlga_austad_talk9:austad_talk10|{playername}, can I be honest with you about something?
dlga_austad_talk10:austad_talk11|Yes, what is it?
dlga_austad_talk10:close_window|Sorry, but I really must be going now.
dlga_austad_talk11:austad_talk12|I...I am not particularly fond of the way Atanos Octiem is running the Third. His vision of resurrecting the ancient Venetor Empire is, well, nonsense.
dlga_austad_talk12:austad_talk13|He fails to recognize the strength of the new powers of Perisno, and I worry he will bring about the destruction of the Venetor legacy once and for all.
dlga_austad_talk13:austad_talk14|I have a proposition for you. I have covertly secured the support of my division and second-in-command Kalero to revolt against the Atanos, and with your help we may actually stand a chance at beating him.
dlga_austad_talk14:austad_talk15|I will warn you however. Even with my division gone, we would be assaulting over 400 troops holed up in this outpost, as well as the Atanos' personal guard regiment. It will no doubt be a punishing fight. What do you say?
dlga_austad_talk15:austad_talk16|Very well. I will help your cause defeat Atanos Octiem and his Legion.
dlga_austad_talk15:close_window|I'm sorry, Visavo, but I do not believe I am currently prepared for such a challenge.
dlga_austad_talk16:close_window|A million thanks, {reg33?madame:sir}. You will not regret overthrowing the militant Octiem. Me and my troops will meet you outside the fort.
dlga_austad_talk17:austad_talk18|We've done it! Sacrifices were made on both sides, but with your help we've captured Octiem and rid the land of his corrupted Legion.
dlga_austad_talk18:austad_talk19|Now that we have control of the fort, we can make some long overdue changes.
dlga_austad_talk19:austad_talk20|The prosperous market that had been shut down by Octiem to discourage external interaction will be repopened at once. We will also no longer send scouting parties out to harrass Perisnoan inhabitants.
dlga_austad_talk20:austad_talk21|As we are now forever in debt to you for preserving our culture, I offer to you Octiem's personal treasury. You can also feel free to use the market and hire troops from our military specialist.
dlga_austad_talk21:close_window|Thank you, and take care {playername}.
dlga_start:sidhethon_talk|What? What do you want? Leave me be. I have no time for beggars.
dlga_sidhethon_talk:close_window|Shut up  Eared!
dlga_start:bw_talk|Hello.
dlga_bw_talk:bw_quest|I am {playername}. Who are you?
dlga_bw_talk:premio|I have done it! Now, the Geldarin Elves are free from oppression!
dlga_bw_quest:talkbw|I am a Geldarin Elf.
dlga_premio:duskfall|You have achieved it! I knew you would do it. My friend, we are forever in your debt.
dlga_duskfall:duskfall2|I have a gift for you. This is Duskfall, one of the finest bows ever forged by Geldarin Elves. It is used now by others as well, but this is the original, best one.
dlga_duskfall2:close_window|Thank you for your gift. I will help the Geldarin Elves defeat the Elintoran Elves. For glory!
dlga_bw_talk:close_window|I haven't got the time.
dlga_talkbw:reminsc2|I long for the destruction of the vile scum of Elintoran Elves. They have comitted atrocities against us that are unspeakable..
dlga_reminsc2:bwcont|I agree.
dlga_reminsc2:close_window|The thought of Elves disgusts me.
dlga_bwcont:bwventa2|I am a Geldarin Elf. My ancestors were once the dominant elf clan, but that time is once gone. We are now pushed aside, ruled by our enemies the cruel, savage Elintoran Elves.
dlga_bwventa2:bwventa3|I will help you defeat the Elintoran Elves.
dlga_bwventa2:bwventa2|Too bad. I dislike elves regardless.
dlga_bwventa3:bwventa31|I think you are a good man. You have potential. My task for you is to conquer the capital city of Forniron, the city we are standing in right here. I think you can do it.
dlga_bwventa3:close_window|Hearing that pleases me. I hope you will succeed.
dlga_bwventa31:close_window|I shall help you conquer Forniron. I have no love for the Elintoran Elves.
dlga_bwventa31:close_window.1|Geldarin elves? There are enough elves in the world already!
dlga_start:bye21|Greetings.
dlga_bye21:close_window|Greetings to you too.
dlga_start:failure|I failed. I'm sorry.
dlga_failure:close_window|Oh . . . Oh well. I suppose you did the best you could. Bad luck, friend.Farewell.
dlga_start:hi|I have done it! I defeated the Red Immortals and took the shield.
dlga_hi:hi1|I knew you could do it! In my vision, I saw that one day a {reg33?lady:man} would come and defeat them! Now, I have a revelation to make: I used to be a Red Immortal.
dlga_hi1:hi2|What?? Then why would you want me to kill them? And are the visions that you talked about all fake?
dlga_hi2:hi3|They betrayed me and cast me out. I have longed for this day. Yes, the vision is fake too. And I have a reward for you...
dlga_hi3:close_window|This is my old set of armor. Farewell, adventurer. I sense a great future in you...
dlga_start:crazy_man_introduction|I have seen it! A vision! A piece of craftsmanship beyond the capabilities of a mortal, wielded by the masters of intimidation... and they all thought it was a lie!
dlga_crazy_man_introduction:crazy_man_lore_1|My good man, what in the world are you rambling on about?
dlga_crazy_man_lore_1:crazy_man_lore_2|I told them they would come! I told them! But no, there is no evidence, and no, the books don't mention them. Now, after long last, I have proof! Real and concrete proof!
dlga_crazy_man_lore_2:crazy_man_lore_3|You told them that what would come? Please, my patience is thinning.
dlga_crazy_man_lore_3:crazy_man_lore_4|The Immortals, sir, the infamous Red Immortals, the 'mythical' elites of the Old Hakkon army! After an account written by the Hakkon historian Mirkhond was discovered some years ago, the tale of these invincible soldiers has been used to inspire many a young lad into enlisting in the army.
dlga_crazy_man_lore_4:crazy_man_lore_5|So you say you have seen these men. Where would I be able to find them?
dlga_crazy_man_lore_5:crazy_man_lore_option|I have indeed seen them, but their location was not clear to me. Perhaps you should ask a more learned man of what they know of this 'mythical' tale. They may know where to send you next. If you defeat these Red Immortals, you will be able to take nigh invincible loot and their legendary shield, the Aegis!
dlga_crazy_man_lore_option:crazy_man_lore_6|Where would I be able to find such a man?
dlga_crazy_man_lore_option:close_window|I'm sorry- I've had enough of this nonsense. Good day.
dlga_crazy_man_lore_6:close_window|The lands of Tolrania is renowned for their interest in the intellects. You will certainly find someone to ask at the center of learning in Perisno.
dlga_start:close_window.43|I shall search for the Red Imortals.
dlga_start:close_window.44|I will take back the relic for you immediately.
dlga_start:close_window.45|I will take back the relic for you immediately.
dlga_start:bye222|Leave me be. I am studying.
dlga_bye222:close_window|Alright. Goodbye.
dlga_bye222:schtalk|Are you a scholar?
dlga_schtalk:schtalk1|-The man sighs - Indeed I am. Who are you?
dlga_schtalk1:sch2|I am {playername}, at your service. I have come here, to Galwe, the great center of learning and education, to seek some answers to my questions. I was hoping a very learned man like you could help me.
dlga_sch2:seekwhat|Well, I suppose I cannot blame a young man for being curious. What it is, exactly, that you seek?
dlga_seekwhat:wut|I wish to know more about the Red Immortals.
dlga_wut:wut1|What?? The Red Immortals are nothing but a children's myth! Leave me be, now. Please.
dlga_wut1:wut2|I'm sorry for bothering, then. Can you at least point me to someone who knows more about it?
dlga_wut2:deal3|-The man shakes his head and rolls his eyes.- Fine. But you must first do something for me.
dlga_deal3:deal4|Of course. What do you need?
dlga_deal4:deal5|The infamous bandit, called Rdahcim, stole a family heirloom of mine. It is a relic, shaped like a cup, and he took it. - The man grinds his teeth in rage - I want you to track that bastard down, destroy his lair, and return to me the relic. Then I shall give you a clue on where the Red Immortals are.
dlga_deal5:questbegin|I will do it.
dlga_questbegin:close_window|Good luck. You can find Rdahcim near the forests around here.
dlga_deal5:close_window|No thanks. It's a waste of my time (fail the quest).
dlga_bye222:11|It's me, {playername}. The one you talked to before. I have your relic.
dlga_11:12|Ah! Very good then, {playername}! Thank you so much for this! Now, I believe I promised you information for the relic. You will need to go and travel to Amarna to consult my colleague, who is an expert on these matters.
dlga_12:close_window|Thank you. Goodbye.
dlga_start:attack1.1|Who the hell are you? And what do you want?
dlga_attack1:close_window.1|Me? I am the one who will kill you.
dlga_start:bye223|If you wouldn't mind, I'm trying to concentrate.
dlga_bye223:close_window|Sorry for bothering you.
dlga_bye223:aschtalk|The scholar of Galwe told me to find you. I have a question to ask.
dlga_aschtalk:aschtalk1|My friend from Galwe, yes. What exactly is it you need?
dlga_aschtalk1:aschtalk2|I am seeking information about the legend of the Red Immortals. More specifically, where they are rumored to be located. He said that you are the greatest expert on the subject in all of Perisno.
dlga_aschtalk2:aschtalk3|Well, I'm afraid I can only relay you once more to another source. I have closely studied the texts of the scholar Mirkhond for many years, but I have done so from a purely factual and historical perspective. What you want is more obscure and absolute. The Mythseeker will know the answer to your question, I have no doubt in my mind.
dlga_aschtalk3:aschtalk4|Another person to track down...where can I find this Mythseeker that you speak of?
dlga_aschtalk4:close_window|The last I checked, he was near Sasspegah castle. Perhaps you should search around there.
dlga_start:bye223.1|I seek them ... the myths...
dlga_bye223:close_window.1|... (you leave the man alone).
dlga_bye223:aschtalk.1|The scholar of Amarna told me to find you. I have a question to ask.
dlga_aschtalk:aschtalk1.1|What is it? Leave me be! I seek the myths, the truth! Do not talk of foolish scholars to me!
dlga_aschtalk1:aschtalk2.1|I am sorry. I have a question about the Red Immortals.
dlga_aschtalk2:aschtalk3.1|The Red Immortals? What business have you with them?
dlga_aschtalk3:aschtalk4.1|Dangerous business. I seek their legendary weapons and shield, and I will kill them.
dlga_aschtalk4:aschtalk5|You want to find them? And kill them? You are nothing but a fool. You cannot defeat the Immortals.
dlga_aschtalk5:aschtalk6|That is your opinion. Please tell me where they are.
dlga_aschtalk6:close_window|-the man smiles to himself-. I will tell you ... you are going to die anyway. Go to the village of Wahran. That is all I shall tell. Now leave me be.
dlga_start:attack1.2|Surrender or die!
dlga_attack1:redimmortals|We are the Red Immortals, from the old Hakkon Empire. I would think twice before attacking.
dlga_redimmortals:close_window|No thanks. You will die, here. Now.
dlga_start:bye21.1|Greetings {playername}.
dlga_bye21:close_window.1|Greetings to you too, great bard.
dlga_aneirin_talk:aneirin_espada|I did it, Taragith. I have the book and the lyre.
dlga_aneirin_espada:aneirin_espada1|Excellent! You have done a great job! Here, let me take those..
dlga_aneirin_espada1:aneirin_espada2|Aren't you going to tell me where the sword is, now??
dlga_aneirin_espada2:aneirin_espada3|Hah! Of course! I have it ... right here, with me!
dlga_aneirin_espada3:aneirin_espada4|... ... WHAT?? You mean to tell me that I went on this wild goose chase to find those two relics JUST for some sort of test that you concocted?
dlga_aneirin_espada4:aneirin_espadaa|Indeed. These two relics are going to be useful for me in my research for the Kingslayer, but they do not provide the answers to where Kingslayer is simply because I have it right here. I did what I did as a test for you. I wanted to see what type of warrior this generation had. You have still done a great favor for me, {playername}. You brought me two important relics. As your payment, I shall give you Kingslayer.
dlga_aneirin_espadaa:aneirin_espada222|Someday, you will be the one people write stories about. I have great hopes for you.
dlga_aneirin_espada222:close_window|Thank you, Taragith. I will make good use of this legendary sword. Farewell..
dlga_aneirin_talk:failure111|Bard, I failed. I'm sorry.
dlga_failure111:close_window|Oh . . . Oh well. I suppose you did the best you could. Bad luck, friend.Farewell.
dlga_start:close_window.46|Come back when you have it.
dlga_start:aneirin_talk|Good day, my {reg33?lady:lord}. I am Targith, Great Bard of Perisno. I am the one who wrote the poems, 'Lost One's Soul', 'The Heir of the Heiress', and many more. I am also responsible for chronicling the histories of many legendary weapons and mysterious occurances in Perisno. Furthermore, I have written historical work for the Scholar's Guild, and my work has been praised all over the world.
dlga_aneirin_talk:aneirin_talk2|Continue, please
dlga_aneirin_talk:close_window|I have other things to do than to listen to a fool. Farewell.
dlga_aneirin_talk2:aneirin_talk3|I'm afraid that if I go on, I will never stop talking. You look like a capable type. I have recently been delving deep into tomes and accounts of the sword, the Kingslayer. It is said that the great Emperor of the Old Perisnoan Empire, Thyceo, slew seven different kings with that one sword to gain dominance. I might have a faint idea of where it is, now that I know most of the details. Would you like to hear my idea?
dlga_aneirin_talk3:aneirin_talk4|Yes. Please tell me.
dlga_aneirin_talk3:close_window|I have other things to do. I believe Kingslayer to be a myth. Farewell.
dlga_aneirin_talk4:aneirin_talk5|To search for the sword, you will need to find two items: a lyre and a book. It is said that Emperor Thyceo's bard wrote the secret of where Kingslayer was hidden in the back of his lyre, named the Lyre of Yralis. If this proves untrue, then the book will hold the secret. The book, called the 'Biography of Emperor Thyceo', has the location of the sword inside. I am certain that the secret to Kingslayer lies inside one of these two items.
dlga_aneirin_talk5:aneirin_talk6|Interesting. Where shall I find the lyre and book?
dlga_aneirin_talk5:close_window|I have better things to do than going on a futile treasure hunt. Farewell.
dlga_aneirin_talk6:aneirin_talk7|Oh, it is easy. You must meet an old reclusive hermit, called the Unusual Hermit by everyone around him, at Waal Castle. He know where the Lyre is. And the Biography of Thyceo, hmm, I think that the Priest Calain can say something about it's whereabouts, but, alas, I dont know where he lives now.Be warned, these two items are going to be very hard to acquire. You will need to be prepared to face many hardships in order to obtain them. However, I believe you can do it. If you succeed, you get the greatest sword of all... the Kingslayer, rumored to have a blade that never dulls. Oh... and, if you do find these items, you will most likely need me to translate the words for you, as they are written in Old Perisnoan dialect.
dlga_aneirin_talk7:close_window|Alright. I shall go search for them.
dlga_aneirin_talk7:close_window.1|I am not interested, sorry. I don't need a new sword and there are no guarantees of success, after all.
dlga_start:pj_talk|What do you want?.
dlga_pj_talk:close_window|Nothing. Goodbye.
dlga_pj_talk:pj_talk2|Are you the one they call the Unusual Hermit? Can you tell me where the Lyre of Yralis is?
dlga_pj_talk2:pj_talk3|I am indeed the hermit. I was once a great general, serving under the Freelancer Guild. But that was a lifetime ago... who are you, and what do you want?
dlga_pj_talk3:pj_talk4|(Lie) I am the descendant of the bard Yralis. I need to know where he hid it.
dlga_pj_talk3:pj_talk5|My name is {playername}. The Great Bard Taragith sent me. We need the Lyre for one of Taragith's discoveries.
dlga_pj_talk4:close_window|I hope you are not trying to fool anyone ... do you think me an idiot? Yralis left no descendant. Begone!
dlga_pj_talk5:pj_talk6|Taragith? Hmm..what has he gotten himself into this time, I wonder? I have heard that you might find the lyre somewhere near the Four Pillars. There, you will find a noble by the name of Galine.
dlga_pj_talk6:pj_talk7|Where? [Intimidate]
dlga_pj_talk6:pj_talk8|Where?
dlga_pj_talk8:close_window|Ah. I'd forgotten that it is not called by that name anymore... it is Westrey Castle.
dlga_pj_talk7:close_window|I don't fear you, {reg33?wench:knave}, I've killed men who were thousand times better warriors than you. But I like your methods. You can find him at Westrey Castle.
dlga_pj_talk:close_window.1|Nothing. Sorry for bothering.
dlga_pj_talk:pj_talk2.1|Are you called Galine?
dlga_pj_talk2:pj_talk3.1|Yes. My name is Galine Goldine, and you are... ?
dlga_pj_talk3:pj_talk4.1|(Lie)I am the last descendant of Emperor Thyceo. I seek the lyre of my ancestor's faithful bard, Yralis.
dlga_pj_talk3:pj_talk5.1|My name is {playername}. Great Bard Taragith sent me. He seeks the lyre of Yralis for a recent discovery he made.
dlga_pj_talk4:close_window.1|Do you think I am stupid? Thyceo left only one descendant, who died early in his reign. Take off.
dlga_pj_talk5:pj_talk6.1|The Lyre of Yralis is an heirloom of my family. However, a Valahir raider by the name of Sekr Frosttongue took it from me.I do not know where it is now, but maybe the Priest Calain will know. Calain once preached to him, I have heard.He currently resides somewhere near Forde but I am not sure exactly his whereabouts. Search around that area.
dlga_pj_talk6:close_window|Well. I will travel to the countryside of Forde, then. Farewell.
dlga_pj_talk:close_window.2|Nothing, I'm leaving.
dlga_pj_talk:pj_talk2.2|Priest Calain? That is you, correct?
dlga_pj_talk2:pj_talk3.2|That is who I am. I used to be full of life ... full of zeal and religion. I am now a priest in all but name. I grow old, and my mind grows old along with me... (his eyes grow distant for a second, then turns back to you). Did Taragith send you? He seeks the Book, does he not?
dlga_pj_talk3:pj_talk4.2|Yes, and I also want the knowledge of the whereabouts of the raider Sekr Frosttongue.
dlga_pj_talk4:pj_talk5|I will tell you where he and the lyre are. But do me a favor first. You must kill me. I would like to quicken my journey to the afterlife. Please, do it.
dlga_pj_talk5:pj_talk6.2|Well. I will do it, if you wish it so.
dlga_pj_talk5:close_window|I am not an assassin. I shall not do it.
dlga_pj_talk5:pj_talk7|No. You are a wise and good man, and I sense you still have many good things to do. Listen, I can help your mission with 500 coins.
dlga_pj_talk6:close_window.1|At last! Your enemy is hiding in Wotin Castle, his old home. And the book ... I have the book. You can take it. Now, do it ...(Your weapon sinks into his flesh. You do not hear any cry of pain, but only see his eyes slowly shutting down, until his body is totally limp. Then, you leave the room slowly, after finding and taking the book.)
dlga_pj_talk7:close_window.1|Hmph... maybe you are right after all. The New Gods still need me ... perhaps. You can find the rogue Sekr at Wotin Castle.(he hands you the book after searching it for a while in his library.)
dlga_start:order2|You have courage, idiot, I thought you were not coming.
dlga_order2:order3|You can still save many lives...
dlga_order3:order4|It is too late. My god, Valhar, wants your blood. You're nothing more than a fool and I'll drink beer in your skull tonight. Then, I will send your skull to Taragith.
dlga_order4:close_window|So be it.
dlga_pj_talk:close_window.3|Forget about it, I'm leaving.
dlga_pj_talk:pj_talk2.3|Sekr Frosttongue. I come to you, looking for the Lyre of Yralis.
dlga_pj_talk2:pj_talk3.3|Another one? Sigh ... Well, maybe you're smarter. The rest of you 'seekers' have died trying. I give you two options: pay me 3,000 aurums, and I will tell you where they are, or get out of my sight.
dlga_pj_talk3:pj_talk4.3|Ok, take 3000 aurums. Tell me, where are they?
dlga_pj_talk4:close_window.2|Somebody bought the lyre two days ago. But you are a fool and I will not give anymore information to you.
dlga_pj_talk3:close_window|I am tired of all these stupid bards' games. I don't want Kingslayer anyways. I give up. So long.
dlga_pj_talk3:pj_talk5.2|There is another option: You die if you don't tell me where they are.
dlga_pj_talk5:close_window.1|Hahaha, you think you can kill me? Alright. Let's fight, outside.

dlga_raid_question:raid_caravan|Yes! It was nothing I couldn't handle.
dlga_raid_question:close_window|No, not yet.
dlga_raid_caravan:close_window|Good job. This is our first step towards the ressurection of the Illican Empire! Come back to me for harder challenges.
dlga_start:ask1|Hello, {reg33?lassie:young man}! Are you looking for a  job or something?
dlga_ask1:god2|Yes!
dlga_god2:god3|The Illicans have been in this land for a millenia, and we have lived in peace unless threatened. We have never intentionally provoked others and are a good people. The Drachens invaded however, and drove us out of our homes and burned our farms! They have commited atrocities. One certain caravan carries a lot of gold. It happens to be traveling to us right now. Can you raid it for me and bring the gold to me for proof?
dlga_god3:godyes|Yes. I will. For the glory of Illica!
dlga_god3:close_window|No, I don't have time for that!
dlga_godyes:close_window|Excellent!
dlga_start:close_window.47|Thank you for freeing me! I managed to steal the gold when the chaos started, but I had no idea I would get this far! Here you go, sir!

dlga_relikwia3:close_window|Goodbye then!

dlga_order2:order3.1|No one you want to know about.

dlga_order4:close_window.1|I want to kill you for the glory of Illica!
dlga_order2:close_window|Nevermind...
dlga_start:order2.2|Hey, I recognize you! You're the one who's been causing trouble around here lately. Have you come willingly to die?
dlga_order2:order3.2|Yes, I have come to kill you, in the name of Illica.
dlga_order3:close_window|Fool! You do not know the power I possess. I have been chosen to destroy the Illican race.
dlga_job1:job2|Indeed. You told me that I could come back for more work. Is there anything else you would like me to do?
dlga_job2:job3|Of course! There is a local Reich lord in the area who has been hunting down Illicans without end. I want you to go and kill him. He is a cruel man with no loyalties except gold and greed. He will have some strong troops, so be careful.
dlga_job3:close_window|Sounds good. I'll do it.
dlga_job3:close_window.1|Maybe later.
dlga_jobb2:jobb3|Yes!

dlga_quest1:quest2|Are there any harder tasks for me to complete?
dlga_quest2:quest3|A harder task, eh? There isn't anything right now, but maybe you can pass the time by defeating a certain dragon priest for me. He is near Voldeburg. What say you?
dlga_quest3:close_window|That's a good idea. I will do it.
dlga_quest3:close_window.1|No thanks. Maybe another time, I am busy at the moment.
dlga_q1:q2|Yes!

dlga_q2:close_window|You are really doing us a big favor. The next task may not be so easy however. Here is the reward for now.
dlga_start:ch1|Have you defeated that monster yet?
dlga_ch1:ch2|I have.
dlga_ch1:close_window|Not yet.
dlga_ch2:close_window|Good job. I always knew you could do it.
dlga_dp1:dp2|I will gladly do it. What is the task?
dlga_dp2:dp3|There is a man by the name of Gunnarr. He has been dubbed the Illican killer, and is a Mercenary soldier from Nisaynia. He has special methods of defeating our men, and none of us have managed to fight him and win.
dlga_dp3:dp4|So you want me defeat him?
dlga_dp4:dp5|Indeed. He has ways to kill Illicans, but not normal men. Scouts report that he is currently near this town. I have every faith in you that you will succeed.
dlga_dp5:close_window|I will do this.
dlga_dp5:close_window.1|No thanks. Maybe another time, I am busy at the moment.
dlga_start:f2|You have quite a bounty on your head from the Reich. I will enjoy crushing your skull. For Wodin and Vanir!
dlga_f2:close_window|I'd like to see you try.
dlga_start:c1|Have you conquered the town yet?
dlga_c1:c2|Yes!
dlga_c1:close_window|I am making the preperations.
dlga_c2:close_window|I cannot thank you enough for what you have done! From now on, you may recruit Illicans from me whenever you like.
dlga_start:illica1|We have come to it at last. Your final task.
dlga_illica1:illica2|What is the task?
dlga_illica2:illica3|It has been many years since our conquerers have banished us and abused us. We are now fighting back - because of you, our hero! It is now time for you to complete your ultimate task. I want you to conquer this city, Voldeburg.
dlga_illica3:illica4|So the time has come?
dlga_illica4:illica5|Indeed. You are our champion now. Fight well, and win!
dlga_illica5:close_window|Thank you.
dlga_illica5:close_window.1|I need to prepare first.
dlga_nodah1:illicalore2|Hello. Can you tell me more about the lore of Illica?
dlga_illicalore2:illicalore3|Of course, my friend! What would you like to know about them?
dlga_illicalore3:genhis1|Tell me about the general history.
dlga_genhis1:genhis2|We are a proud race, and have been living in Perisno for centuries. We come way before the Elintorans, or even the Third Legion, I daresay. Our culture is rich and deep.
dlga_genhis2:genhis3|The Reichans came a few years ago, inten on destroying us. We were already weak from a recently civil war between us and an opposing clan. The Reich came, built huge sprawling cities in our land, and drove us out.
dlga_genhis3:genhis4|However, you, our hero, came in time. You helped us drive the Reich out and reclaim some of our land. For that, we than you eternally. You will be remembered in our stories alongside our other great heroes like Zeladeck, Myrians, and Ha'beo.
dlga_genhis4:close_window|Very interesting. Good bye.
dlga_illicalore3:close_window|Nevermind.
dlga_nodah1:nodah2|I would like to recruit some Illicans.
dlga_nodah1:close_window|Farewell.
dlga_nodah2:nodah3|Of course! They all cost 150.
dlga_nodah3:close_window|Actually, I don't need them at the moment
dlga_nodah3:nodah4|I would like to hire one Illican Hunter.
dlga_nodah3:nodah4.1|I would like to hire five Illican Hunters.
dlga_nodah3:nodah4.2|I would like to hire ten Illican Hunters. 
dlga_nodah3:nodah4.3|I would like to hire twenty Illican Hunters. 
dlga_nodah3:close_window.1|That is too expensive.
dlga_nodah4:close_window|Thank you. Goodbye for now.
dlga_start:wep_enth_talk1|Well done, good {reg33?madame:sir}.
dlga_start:wep_enth_talk1.1|Welcome back to Arendal. How is your quest going?
dlga_start:we_ask|Hello there, you fine young fellow. Would you like me to tell you about the Dueler?
dlga_start:close_window.48|Good luck on your quest.
dlga_we_ask:we_talk|The Dueler? Never heard of him. Go on, you have my intrigue.
dlga_we_ask:close_window|No thank you. I have something urgent to attend to.
dlga_we_talk:we_continue|Well, to be honest, I know very little about the Dueler himself. What I do know more about is his...weapon.
dlga_we_continue:we_talk2|A weapon? What kind, a sword?
dlga_we_talk2:we_ask2|A sword, yes. A very special kind of sword; a rapier. This rapier, though I have never seen it myself, is supposed to be one of the finest pieces of craftsmanship to ever exist in Perisno; its speed and the Dueler's own skill making him nigh invincible in combat.
dlga_we_ask2:we_talk3|Interesting. Where can I find out more about the Dueler and this rapier of his?
dlga_we_talk3:close_window|The dueler holds godlike status among the trainers of Perisno who can be found the many training ground locations. They will probably know more about him than I do. Good luck.
dlga_wep_enth_talk1:wep_enth_talk2|Good news. I have the rapier.
dlga_wep_enth_talk2:wep_enth_talk3|No way! Do you mind if I...hold it?
dlga_wep_enth_talk3:wep_enth_talk4|Go ahead.
dlga_wep_enth_talk3:wep_enth_talk5|I'd rather you not.
dlga_wep_enth_talk4:wep_enth_talk6|Fantastic. It's so incredibly light, yet strong as well. It seems to be designed for thrusting attacks.
dlga_wep_enth_talk5:wep_enth_talk6|Fair enough, it looks very valuable. A sword of that design seems very adept at thrusting attacks.
dlga_wep_enth_talk6:wep_enth_talk7|You're a very lucky {reg33?woman:man} to have gotten your hands on such a weapon. Take good care of it for me, will you?
dlga_wep_enth_talk7:close_window|Will do.
dlga_trainer_talk:trainer_rapier_talk5b|I am here to fight your men.
dlga_trainer_talk:trainer_rapier_talk|Actually, I have a question to ask you about...more mysterious matters.
dlga_trainer_rapier_talk:trainer_rapier_talk2|A question? Ask away.
dlga_trainer_rapier_talk2:trainer_rapier_talk3|I was told that you trainers hold a certain man with the utmost respect for his proficiency in combat. I was wondering if you could tell me a little more about this man, the Dueler.
dlga_trainer_rapier_talk3:trainer_rapier_talk4|The Dueler? My my, it has been many years since I last heard that name. To answer your question: yes, I can tell you a little more about him. However, as I don't want this rather valuable information to fall into the wrong hands, you must first prove your worth to me.
dlga_trainer_rapier_talk4:trainer_rapier_talk5|And how might I do that?
dlga_trainer_rapier_talk5b:trainer_rapier_talk6|Excellent. Are you ready to begin?
dlga_trainer_rapier_talk5:trainer_rapier_talk6|Well, in a normal practice fight, I would start off easy and work you up the tiers of difficulty. Instead of doing that, I will put you up against 3 of my finest fighters in a row, and then I will tell you what you want to hear. Are you ready?
dlga_trainer_rapier_talk6:trainer_rapier_talk7|Yes I am.
dlga_trainer_rapier_talk7:close_window|Here you go then. Good luck.
dlga_trainer_rapier_talk6:trainer_rapier_talk8|Just a minute. I am not ready yet.
dlga_trainer_rapier_talk8:close_window|Hey, You will never make it if you don't practice.
dlga_trainer_practice_1:trainer_rapier_talk9|Well done, very well done. Not only have you proven yourself but you have also impressed me greatly. I am confident that I can now tell you what I know.
dlga_trainer_rapier_talk9:trainer_rapier_talk10|It was on that day, the first and last I saw of him, that this man approached my training field. He did not give a name, so thereafter we simply reffered to him as 'the Dueler' for reasons that will soon become apparent.
dlga_trainer_rapier_talk10:trainer_rapier_talk11|The moment he began to spar I knew there was something different about him. It was his flawless technique, his record-setting defeat of my fighters, maybe even the sun dancing off that fancy sword of his- it was incredible. I even threw uneven matchups against him, even outnumbered twelve to one he managed to dodge and slash and parry his way to victory.
dlga_trainer_rapier_talk11:trainer_rapier_talk12|Soon my men had all but collapsed from exhaustion, and the Dueler, sheathing his narrow sword, turned and departed with nothing but a nod in my direction.
dlga_trainer_rapier_talk12:close_window|My account of the Dueler is one of many among trainers in Perisno, and you can find a compendium of information on the man in the great library of Galwe. Farewell, and good luck in your quest.
dlga_start:literary_talk7|Oh, you again? What is it?
dlga_start:literary_talk1|I beg your pardon, but this book requires my full concentration.
dlga_start:close_window.49|Pardon me, but this book requires my full concentration.
dlga_literary_talk1:literary_talk2|I don't want to disrupt your work, but I was hoping to find someone who can direct me to a specific book.
dlga_literary_talk1:close_window|My apologies.
dlga_literary_talk2:literary_talk3|Alright then, quickly. What are you looking for?
dlga_literary_talk3:literary_talk4|I was told this library houses a compilation of information about a man named, or...nicknamed, the Dueler?
dlga_literary_talk4:literary_talk5|Ah, yes! Funny you should inquire about the book at this time, as I was actually about to return it to the library. I had planned on reading it but was sidetracked by my newfound interest in Tolranian political history.
dlga_literary_talk5:literary_talk6|Did you know that Nibor Hood, the nefarious leader of the Outlaws, is the brother of the Tolranian claimant, Lady Tylora? How fascinating!
dlga_literary_talk6:close_window|Anyway, where was I...oh yes. I suppose I can lend the book to you for a little while, until you find what you need. So long.
dlga_literary_talk7:literary_talk8|I'm here to return the book you kindly lent me.
dlga_literary_talk7:literary_talk11|Unfortunately, the book is no longer in my possession. How much do I owe you?
dlga_literary_talk8:literary_talk9|Excellent! I was beginning to worry that you weren't going to bring it back.
dlga_literary_talk9:literary_talk10|I made some notes here and there, and added some information I think you'll find to be...quite relevant the the story of the Dueler.
dlga_literary_talk10:close_window|You...you wrote in a library book!? How could you defile such a delicately assembled compilation of information! Besides, how useful could your little anecdote be? Gah! I don't have time for you right now.
dlga_literary_talk11:literary_talk12|You lost the book!? Gah...the library will want at least 1000 aurums for losing such a valuable piece of information.
dlga_literary_talk12:literary_talk13|Right, here you go.
dlga_literary_talk13:close_window|Fine. Now leave me to my studies, you irresponsible swine.
dlga_literary_talk12:literary_talk14|I don't have that kind of money.
dlga_literary_talk14:close_window|Well, I would advise you get out of my sights before I call the city watch on you!
dlga_start:close_window.50|You've far exceeded my expectations {reg33?Lady:Lord} {playername}. I will be sure to spread the word of your great accomplishment on this day.
dlga_start:close_window.51|You've far exceeded my expectations {reg33?Lady:Lord} {playername}. I will be sure to spread the word of your great accomplishment on this day.
dlga_start:close_window.52|He's a tough one isn't he? I hope you learned a lesson or two about...humility among other things.
dlga_start:arena28_talk11|That was very impressive, young {reg33?lady:man}. Don't feel too good about yourself, however; the Dueler's talent cannot be compared to the men you just fought. Are you sure you still want to do this?
dlga_start:arena28_talk11.1|Are you ready to take him on again?
dlga_start:close_window.53|Hmm...as I suspected, it seems you need more practice after all. Come back when you and your men have trained harder.
dlga_start:arena28_talk10|Are you ready?
dlga_start:arena28_talk5|Hello again. So what did you want from the Dueler?
dlga_start:arena28_talk1|Good day friend. How can I help you?
dlga_arena28_talk_start:arena28_talk1|Anything else?
dlga_arena28_talk1:arena28_talk2_1|That's not...THE Dueler, is it? I've been looking all over for him.
dlga_arena28_talk1:arena28_talk2_2|Are you currently running any tournaments?
dlga_arena28_talk1:close_window|Oh I'm just looking around, thanks.
dlga_arena28_talk2_2:arena28_talk_start|Unfortunately, no. This space has been...reserved for the time being.
dlga_arena28_talk2_1:arena28_talk3|Ah, so I see you've heard of him. Lucky for you, you've found the place that he and his apprentices train.
dlga_arena28_talk3:arena28_talk4|He prefers Qaletaqa because few Perisno mainlanders dare to venture out into the Aroulian jungle, and therefore he can perfect his art in seclusion.
dlga_arena28_talk4:arena28_talk5|So, what would you like from him? He doesn't normally interact with strangers, however I'm sure he'd be willing to listen to someone with your level of determination.
dlga_arena28_talk5:arena28_talk6_1|I am here to challenge the Dueler to a duel.
dlga_arena28_talk5:arena28_talk_lore|Who exactly is the Dueler?
dlga_arena28_talk5:arena28_talk6_2|I'll be back in a little bit.
dlga_arena28_talk6_1:arena28_talk7|You want to...duel him? I don't mean to be rude, but I think that may be a bad idea.
dlga_arena28_talk_lore:arena28_talk_lore2|Nobody knows for sure who he is or where he comes from, and he isn't exactly the garrulous type. The few times I have heard him speak, however, his accent sounded like nothing I had ever heard before.
dlga_arena28_talk_lore2:arena28_talk4|Other than that he is not from Perisno, your guess is as good as mine. I do know that he wields that rapier of his with incredible mastery, better than anyone I've ever seen.
dlga_arena28_talk6_2:close_window|Take your time.
dlga_arena28_talk7:arena28_talk8|I'll be just fine. I'm ready to fight.
dlga_arena28_talk7:close_window|On second though, I need some time to prepare first.
dlga_arena28_talk8:arena28_talk9|Well I won't put you up against the Dueler right away. First, you and your first seven men can go up against his eight apprentices so that I can get an idea of your skill.
dlga_arena28_talk9:arena28_talk10|Are you ready?
dlga_arena28_talk10:close_window|Let's go.
dlga_arena28_talk10:close_window.1|Let me reorder my party first.
dlga_arena28_talk11:close_window|I'm ready.
dlga_arena28_talk11:close_window.1|Give me some time to recover from that last fight.
dlga_start:close_window.54|[He doesn't seem to hear you]
dlga_start:dueler_talk1|...
dlga_dueler_talk1:dueler_talk2|So I have been defeated.
dlga_dueler_talk2:dueler_talk3|It was only a matter of time before my craft with the sword was bested by a challenger.
dlga_dueler_talk3:dueler_talk4|I suppose you have more right than I to train these men. Take care of them for me.
dlga_dueler_talk4:dueler_talk5|I also feel obliged to give you something else, for I can no longer hold it in good conscience.
dlga_dueler_talk5:dueler_talk6|This rapier is made of precious Parandovan titanium, forged by my country's greatest blacksmith and designed to be the lightest and fastest sword ever made.
dlga_dueler_talk6:dueler_talk7|It was given to me for becoming the most skilled fighter in Parandova, and I was sent by my king to explore and display my strength to the world.
dlga_dueler_talk7:dueler_talk8|It is now my duty to give the rapier to you, {reg33?lady:lord} {playername}.
dlga_dueler_talk8:dueler_talk9|You are a most gracious opponent. Thank you for this gift.
dlga_dueler_talk8:dueler_talk8b|I can't accept such a valuable treasure of your people.
dlga_dueler_talk8b:dueler_talk9|You are generous to decline, but I must insist. This sword no longer belongs to me.
dlga_dueler_talk9:close_window|Farewell, {playername}. It is time for me to return to my land.
dlga_lord_talk:oim_lord_sp_task|I would be glad to take upon myself a special mission.
dlga_oim_lord_sp_task:close_window|A mission? {playername}, I am not in position to ask you to do anything. However, I have a gift for you that I planned to delever to you for quite some time. Please accept it as a sign of our friendship.
dlga_oim_qst_kidalovo_z_konyem_dlg:oim_qst_kidalovo_z_konyem_dlg_1|Could you perhaps do me a small favor, {reg33?madame:sir}? The task is this: I had planned to give my ruler a wolf as a gift, but alas, war has called and I cannot deliver the beast. Can you convey the animal to him in my stead?
dlga_oim_qst_kidalovo_z_konyem_dlg_1:oim_qst_kidalovo_z_konyem_dlg_pos|Agree...
dlga_oim_qst_kidalovo_z_konyem_dlg_pos:oim_qst_kidalovo_z_konyem_dlg_pos2|Very well, I would not shy from taking this job.
dlga_oim_qst_kidalovo_z_konyem_dlg_pos2:close_window|Here is the wolf, and here is the money for his keeping. Know this -- if you should lose the steed, or fail to deliver it in time, you'll have only yourself to blame for what follows.
dlga_oim_qst_kidalovo_z_konyem_dlg_1:oim_qst_kidalovo_z_konyem_dlg_neg|Refuse...
dlga_oim_qst_kidalovo_z_konyem_dlg_neg:oim_qst_kidalovo_z_konyem_dlg_neg_1|I am honored to hear that you would wish to bestow such an important task upon me... But alas, I have no time to play nurse to a wolf.
dlga_oim_qst_kidalovo_z_konyem_dlg_neg_1:close_window|The decision is yours. I shall find myself another who can aid me in this.
dlga_oim_horse_ambush_dlg:oim_horse_ambush_dlg_1|Well hello, wayfarer! Why such a hurry? What is it that troubles you?
dlga_oim_horse_ambush_dlg_1:oim_horse_ambush_dlg_2|And who are you to ask that?
dlga_oim_horse_ambush_dlg_2:oim_horse_ambush_dlg_3|Who am I? Why, I am a freedom fighter, at your service. -- And the keeper of this road, too.
dlga_oim_horse_ambush_dlg_3:oim_horse_ambush_dlg_4|What is that supposed to mean?
dlga_oim_horse_ambush_dlg_4:oim_horse_ambush_dlg_5|No need for rude words, wayfarer. Better show us what you have in the cart, now.
dlga_oim_horse_ambush_dlg_5:oim_horse_ambush_dlg_6|In the cart be arms, and I assure you I can use them...
dlga_oim_horse_ambush_dlg_6:close_window|Then we shall just have to see about that...
dlga_oim_horse_ambush_dlg2:close_window|I believe not my eyes! What a treasure you have here, my good {man/lady}. Perhaps we shall take it!
dlga_oim_horse_delivered_dlg:oim_horse_delivered_dlg_1|{reg33?madame:sir}, I brought you a modest gift from Baron Gereon
dlga_oim_horse_delivered_dlg_1:close_window|What a beautiful strange beast! But it is taking a great risk, travelling these roads with such a wolf. Here, take this for your troubles.
dlga_oim_lord_sp_task:lord_pretalk|I don't have any work for you.
dlga_member_intel_liaison:member_intel_liaison_results|What have you discovered?
dlga_start:member_intel_liaison|Greetings, stranger.
dlga_member_intel_liaison:close_window|It's time to pull you out. Let's leave town separately, but join me soon after
dlga_member_intel_liaison:close_window.1|You're doing good work. Stay here for a little longer
dlga_member_intel_liaison_results:member_intel_liaison|{s11} I notice that you have been keeping some notes about individual lords. I have annotated those with my findings.

dlga_start:companion_rehire.3|So... Do you want me back yet?
dlga_minister_issues:minister_pretalk|There is a matter which needs your attention. The quarrel between {s11} and {s12} has escalated to a point where it has become unseemly. If you do intervene, you risk offending one of the lords. However, if you do nothing, you risk appearing weak. Such are the burdens of kingship, {reg33?my lady:sire}.
dlga_minister_issues:minister_talk|{s1} currently does not have a lord. You may wish to keep it this way, as lords will sometimes gravitate towards lieges who have land to offer, but for the time being, no one is collecting any of its rents.
dlga_minister_issues:minister_talk.1|At this point, there are no particularly urgent matters which need your attention. I should point out though, sire, that I am not very skilled in the ways of politics, and that I am anxious to return to private life. If you wish to issue any but the most basic directives, I suggest appointing a trusted companion in my stead. In the meantime, is there anything you wish done?
dlga_minister_issues:minister_talk.2|If I may offer you a world of advice, my {reg33?lady:lord}, it seems that your right to rule as an independent monarch is not sufficiently recognized, and this may bring us problems further down the road. It may be advisable to find another kingdom with whom you have shared interests and seek its recognition, to establish yourself as an equal with Perisno's other kings.

The matter is in God's hands now, and all we can do is pray for his recovery.Anyway, I thank you for lending your surgeon to me {reg33?madam:sir}. You have a noble spirit. I will not forget it.
dlga_lord_start:wedding_ceremony_bride_vow|May the heavens witness that I am ready to give you my {s11} {s4}, to have in marriage...
dlga_lord_start:lord_wedding_reschedule|It is good to see you, {playername}. We look forward to the wedding, as soon as we can all gather together for the feast.{s12}
dlga_lord_wedding_reschedule:lord_start|It is no problem. I can wait.
dlga_lord_wedding_reschedule:lord_return_dower|I have no faith that this wedding will be concluded. Please return my dower.
dlga_lord_return_dower:close_window|Well, that is your right, if you indeed have no confidence in our family's commitments. Take your money.
dlga_lord_start:lord_generic_mission_completed.1|Hah! Our little plot against {s3} worked perfectly, {playername}.The fool has lost one of {reg0?her:his} most valuable retainers, and we are one step closer to bringing {reg0?her:him} to {reg0?her:his} knees.Here, this purse contains {reg5} aurums, and I wish you to have it. You deserve every copper.And, need I remind you, there could be much more to come if you've a mind to earn it...
dlga_lord_start:close_window|You werent't able to complete a simple task. I had set up everything.The only thing you needed to do was sacrifice a messenger, and we would be celebrating now.But no, you were too damned honorable, weren't you?
dlga_lord_start:quest_meet_spy_in_enemy_town_completed|Have you brought me any news about that task I gave you? You know the one I mean...
dlga_quest_meet_spy_in_enemy_town_completed:quest_meet_spy_in_enemy_town_completed_2|I have the reports you wanted right here.
dlga_quest_meet_spy_in_enemy_town_completed_2:lord_pretalk|Ahh, well done. It's good to have competent {reg33?people:men} on my side. Here is the payment I promised you.
dlga_lord_start:lord_pretalk|Brilliant work, {playername}! Whatever you did, the nobles of the {s13} are clamoring for war!Soon, the time will come for us to reap the benefits of our hard work, from fields ripe for plunder.This war is going to make us rich, mark my words!
dlga_lord_start:lord_collect_debt_completed|I'm told that you've collected the money owed me from {s7}. Good, it's past time I had it back.I believe I promised to give you one-fifth of it all, eh?Well, that makes {reg3} aurums, so if you give me my share -- that's {reg4} aurums -- you can keep the rest.
dlga_lord_collect_debt_completed:lord_collect_debt_pay|Of course, {s65}. {reg4} aurums, all here.
dlga_lord_collect_debt_pay:lord_pretalk|I must admit I'm impressed, {playername}. I had lost hope of ever getting this money back.Please accept my sincere thanks.
dlga_lord_collect_debt_completed:lord_collect_debt_no_pay|I am afraid I don't have the money with me sir.
dlga_lord_collect_debt_no_pay:close_window|Is this a joke?I know full well that {s7} gave you the money, and I want every aurum owed to me, {reg33?madam:sir}.As far as I'm concerned, I hold you personally in my debt until I see that silver.
dlga_lord_start:close_window.1|I heard you got rid of that poxy merchant that was causing me so much grief.I can see you're not afraid to get your hands dirty, eh? I like that in a {reg33?woman:man}.Here's your reward. Remember, {playername}, stick with me and we'll go a long, long way together.
dlga_lord_start:close_window.2|Oh, it's you. Enlighten me, how exactly does one lose a simple fight to some poxy, lowborn merchant?Truly, if I ever need my guardsmen to take a lesson in how to lay down and die, I'll be sure to come to you.Just leave me be, {playername}, I have things to do.
dlga_lord_start:lord_kill_local_merchant_let_go|You! Do you have sawdust between your ears? Did you think that when I said to kill the merchant,I meant you to have a nice chat with him and then let him go?! What possessed you?
dlga_lord_kill_local_merchant_let_go:lord_kill_local_merchant_let_go_2|Sir, I made sure he will not act against you.
dlga_lord_kill_local_merchant_let_go_2:lord_pretalk|Piffle. You were supposed to remove him, not give him a sermon and send him on his way.He had better do as you say, or you'll both regret it.Here, this is half the money I promised you. Don't say a word, {playername}, you're lucky to get even that.I have little use for {reg33?women:men} who cannot follow orders.
dlga_lord_start:lord_follow_spy_completed|Beautiful work, {playername}! You captured both the spy and {reg0?her:his} handler, just as I'd hoped,and the pair are now safely ensconced in my dungeon, waiting to be questioned.My torturer shall be busy tonight! Anyway, I'm very pleased with your success, {playername}, and I give youthis purse as a token of my appreciation.
dlga_lord_start:lord_follow_spy_half_completed|Blast and damn you! I wanted TWO prisoners, {playername} -- what you've brought me is one step short ofuseless! I already know everything the spy knows, it was the handler I was after.Here, half a job gets you half a reward. Take it and begone.
dlga_lord_start:lord_follow_spy_half_completed.1|I asked you for two prisoners, {playername}, not one. Two. Still, I suppose you did capture the spy's handler,the more important one of the pair. The spy will not dare return here and will prove quite useless towhatever master {reg0?she:he} served. 'Tis better than nothing.However, you'll understand if I pay you half the promised reward for what is but half a success.
dlga_lord_start:lord_follow_spy_failed|Truly, {playername}, you are nothing short of totally incompetent.Failing to capture both the spy AND {reg0?her:his} handler plumbs astonishing new depths of failure.Forget any reward I offered you. You've done nothing to earn it.
dlga_lord_follow_spy_half_completed:lord_pretalk|I did my best, {s65}.
dlga_lord_follow_spy_completed:lord_pretalk|Thank you, {s65}.
dlga_lord_follow_spy_failed:lord_pretalk|Hrm. As you like, {s65}.
dlga_lord_start:lord_generic_mission_completed.2|Splendid work, {playername}. All the serfs are back, properly cowed, and they're busy preparing for the harvest.You certainly earned your reward. Here, take it, with my compliments.
dlga_lord_start:lord_bring_back_runaway_serfs_failed|{playername}. I have been waiting patiently for my serfs, yet none have returned. Have you an explanation?Were you outwitted by simple fieldhands, or are you merely incompetent?Or perhaps you are plotting with my enemies, intending to ruin me...
dlga_lord_bring_back_runaway_serfs_failed:lord_bring_back_runaway_serfs_failed_1a|Forgive me, {s65}, those serfs were slippery as eels.
dlga_lord_bring_back_runaway_serfs_failed:lord_bring_back_runaway_serfs_failed_1b|Perhaps if you had treated them better...
dlga_lord_bring_back_runaway_serfs_failed_1a:lord_pretalk|Hmph, that is hardly an excuse for failure, {playername}.Now if you will excuse me, I need to recruit new men to work these fields before we all starve.
dlga_lord_bring_back_runaway_serfs_failed_1b:close_window|Hah, now you reveal your true colours, traitor! Your words match your actions all too well. I should never have trusted you.
dlga_lord_start:lord_runaway_serf_half_completed|You disappoint me, {playername}. There were 3 groups of serfs that I charged you to return. 3. Not {reg17}.I suppose the ones who did come back shall have to work twice as hard to make up for those that got away.As for your reward, {playername}, I'll only pay you for the serfs you returned, not the ones you let fly.Here. Take it, and let this business be done.
dlga_lord_runaway_serf_half_completed:lord_pretalk|Thank you, {s65}. You are indeed generous.
dlga_lord_runaway_serf_half_completed:lord_pretalk.1|Bah, this proved to be a waste of my time.
dlga_lord_start:lord_deal_with_bandits_completed|{playername}, I was told that you have crushed the bandits at my village of {s5}. Please know that I am most grateful to you for that.Please, let me pay the expenses of your campaign. Here, I hope these {reg14} aurums will be adequate.
dlga_lord_deal_with_bandits_completed:lord_pretalk|Not a problem, {s65}.
dlga_lord_deal_with_bandits_completed:lord_pretalk.1|Glad to be of service.
dlga_lord_deal_with_bandits_completed:lord_pretalk.2|It was mere child's play.
dlga_lord_start:lord_pretalk.1|Damn it, {playername}. I heard that you were unable to drive off the bandits from my village of {s5}, and thanks to you, my village now lies in ruins.Everyone said that you were a capable warrior, but appearently, they were wrong.
dlga_lord_start:lord_deliver_cattle_to_army_thank|Ah, {playername}. My quartermaster has informed me of your delivery, {reg13} heads of cattle, as I requested. I'm impressed.
dlga_lord_deliver_cattle_to_army_thank:lord_pretalk|Not a problem, {s65}.
dlga_lord_deliver_cattle_to_army_thank:lord_pretalk.1|Glad to be of service.
dlga_lord_deliver_cattle_to_army_thank:lord_pretalk.2|Mere child's play.
dlga_lord_start:lord_scout_waypoints_thank|You make a good scout, {playername}. My runner just brought me your reports of the mission to {s13}, {s14} and {s15}. Well done.
dlga_lord_scout_waypoints_thank:lord_pretalk|A simple task, {s65}.
dlga_lord_scout_waypoints_thank:lord_pretalk.1|Nothing I couldn't handle.
dlga_lord_scout_waypoints_thank:lord_pretalk.2|My pleasure, {s65}.
dlga_lord_start:lord_mission_told_deliver_cattle_to_army|The army's supplies are dwindling too quickly, {playername}. I need you to bring me {reg3} heads of cattle so I can keep the troops fed. I care very little about where you get them, just bring them to me as soon as you can.
dlga_lord_mission_told_deliver_cattle_to_army:lord_mission_told_deliver_cattle_to_army_accepted|Very well, I can find you some cattle.
dlga_lord_mission_told_deliver_cattle_to_army:lord_mission_told_deliver_cattle_to_army_rejected|Sorry, sir, I have other plans.
dlga_lord_mission_told_deliver_cattle_to_army_accepted:close_window|Excellent! You know what to do, {playername}, now get to it. I need that cattle sooner rather than later.
dlga_lord_mission_told_deliver_cattle_to_army_rejected:close_window|That . . . is unfortunate, {playername}. I shall have to find someone else who's up to the task. Please go now, I've work to do.
dlga_lord_start:lord_pretalk.2|Thank you for answering the summons, {playername}. However, as we are now at peace, we do not need your services. You may attend to your other business.
dlga_lord_start:lord_report_to_army_asked|Ah, you have arrived at last, {playername}. We've been expecting you. I hope you have brought with you troops of sufficient number and experience.
dlga_lord_report_to_army_asked:lord_report_to_army_completed|I have a company of good, hardened soldiers with me. We are ready to join you.
dlga_lord_report_to_army_asked:lord_report_to_army_continue|I don't have the sufficient number of troops yet. I will need some more time.
dlga_lord_report_to_army_completed:close_window|Excellent. We'll be moving soon. Now -- you are a {reg33?warrior:man} of sound judgement, and we trust that you will do what is necessary to support our campaign. I do not require you to remain close at hand, and I will not count it against you if you believe that your forces would be of better use elsewhere. But if you do choose to remain with me, to support me in battle, that would be appreciated. I may also have additional tasks for you to perform.
dlga_lord_report_to_army_continue:close_window|Then you'd better hurry. We'll be moving out soon against the enemy and I need every able hand we can muster.
dlga_lord_start:lord_mission_told_scout_waypoints|{playername}, I need a volunteer to scout the area. We're sorely lacking on information,and I simply must have a better picture of the situation before we can proceed.I want you to go to {s13}, {s14} and {s15} and report back whatever you find.
dlga_lord_mission_told_scout_waypoints:lord_mission_told_scout_waypoints_accepted|You've found your volunteer, sir.
dlga_lord_mission_told_scout_waypoints:lord_mission_told_scout_waypoints_rejected|I fear I must decline.
dlga_lord_mission_told_scout_waypoints_accepted:close_window|Good {reg33?lass:man}! Simply pass near {s13}, {s14} and {s15} and check out what's there. Make a note of anything you find and return to me as soon as possible.
dlga_lord_mission_told_scout_waypoints_rejected:lord_pretalk|Hm. I'm disappointed, {playername}. Very disappointed. We'll talk later, I need to go and find somebody to scout for us.
dlga_lord_generic_mission_thank:lord_generic_mission_completed|You have been most helpful, {playername}. My thanks.
dlga_lord_generic_mission_completed:lord_pretalk|It was an honour to serve.
dlga_lord_start:lord_pay_debt_2|I think you owe me {reg1} aurums, {playername}. Do you intend to pay your debt anytime soon?
dlga_lord_pay_debt_2:lord_pay_debt_3_1|That is why I came, {s65}. Here it is, every aurum I owe you.
dlga_lord_pay_debt_2:lord_pay_debt_3_2|Alas, I don't have sufficient funds, {s65}. But I'll pay you soon enough.
dlga_lord_pay_debt_3_1:lord_pretalk|Ah, excellent. You are a {reg33?woman:man} of honour, {playername}. I am satisfied. Your debt to me has been paid in full.
dlga_lord_pay_debt_3_2:lord_pretalk|Well, don't keep me waiting much longer.
dlga_lord_start:lord_start.1|By the way, I hope you get a chance to meet my {s11}, {s14}.  
dlga_lord_start:lord_start.2|By the way, I am sure that my {s11}, {s14}, would be delighted were you to pay {reg0?her:him} a visit. {reg0?She:He} awaits you in {reg0?her:his} chambers.
dlga_lord_start:lord_buy_prisoner|I heard that you have captured our enemy {s3} and {reg0?she:he} is with you at the moment.I can pay you {reg6} aurums for {reg0?her:him} if you want to get rid of {reg0?her:him}.You can wait for {reg0?her:his} family to pay {reg0?her:his} ransom of course, but there is no telling how long that will take, eh?
dlga_lord_buy_prisoner:lord_buy_prisoner_accept|I accept your offer. I'll leave {s3} to you for {reg6} aurums.
dlga_lord_buy_prisoner:lord_buy_prisoner_deny|I fear I can't accept your offer.
dlga_lord_buy_prisoner_accept:lord_pretalk|Excellent! Here's your {reg6} aurums.I'll send some men to take him to our prison with due haste.
dlga_lord_buy_prisoner_deny:lord_pretalk|Mmm. As you wish, {playername}, but you'll not get a better offer. Take it from me.
dlga_lord_start:lord_talk|I lift a {s5} to your health, {playername}! You are most gracious to host us on this occasion. Now, what is it?
dlga_lord_start:lord_talk.1|To your health, {reg33?your Highness:Sire}. Long may you reign. What is your bidding?
dlga_lord_start:lord_talk.2|What is your bidding?

dlga_lord_talk:offer_gift_quest_complete|I have the materials for {s4}'s gift.
dlga_lord_talk:intrigue_quest_state_complaint|My {reg65?lady:lord} -- there is something I wish to tell you in confidence, about one of your vassals.
dlga_intrigue_quest_state_complaint:lord_pretalk|Whatever you have to say, I would ask you to wait until we are alone.
dlga_intrigue_quest_state_complaint:intrigue_quest_state_complaint_plyr|What is it? I value your opinion, although I hope that you are not trying to sow dissension among my vassals? 
dlga_intrigue_quest_state_complaint_plyr:lord_intrigue_quest_complaint_stated|My liege -- {s4} is widely held by your vassals to be {s5}, and a liability to your realm
dlga_intrigue_quest_state_complaint_plyr:lord_pretalk|Actually, my liege, never mind.
dlga_lord_intrigue_quest_complaint_stated:lord_pretalk|Hmm... This is troubling to hear. Although I do not encourage my vassals to speak ill of each other, I value your opinion. Perhaps I should think twice about granting {s4} any further fiefs or offices...
dlga_lord_intrigue_quest_complaint_stated:intrigue_quest_state_complaint_failed|Sew discord among my vassals, will you? With everything else going on, do you think I appreciate my nobles turning on each other like quarreling dogs? Let me ask you this -- did someone put you up this?
dlga_intrigue_quest_state_complaint_failed:intrigue_quest_state_accept_blame|I stand by my words, my liege.
dlga_intrigue_quest_state_complaint_failed:intrigue_quest_state_deflect_blame|Yes, sire -- {s4} put me up to denouncing {s5}!
dlga_intrigue_quest_state_accept_blame:lord_pretalk|Indeed. You may stand by your words, but keep them to yourself. I will not have you undercutting my faithful follower {s4}.
dlga_intrigue_quest_state_deflect_blame:lord_pretalk|I thought as much. Here's some advice for you, {reg33?lassie:lad} -- don't meddle in the quarrels of others. Now, enough of this.
dlga_lord_talk:lord_denounce_1|I want to tell you something -- we have had enough of your {s4} ways

dlga_lord_denounce_2:lord_pretalk|Never mind. You must have misheard me.
dlga_lord_denounce_3:close_window|Why would you say such a thing? To insult me like this, in spite of our friendship -- how much crueler is a knife in my back from an erstwhile friends, than the sword of a sworn foe. I do not know what game you are playing, but I want no part of it. Go away. I do not want to look at you.
dlga_lord_denounce_3:close_window.1|Hmf. Really? Is that your opinion, or did one of my rivals put those words in your mouth? Never mind. I will not play your game. Go away, and take your intrigues with you.
dlga_lord_denounce_3:lord_denounce_4|I will not have you shame me in public, {reg33?my lady:sir}. Retract your words, or meet me on the duelling ground.
dlga_lord_denounce_3:lord_denounce_4.1|Is that so? Well, hear this -- you're a snake, and a {reg33?strumpet:knave}, and -- if you don't meet me on the duelling ground -- a coward. What say you to that? Do you retract your words, or shall we cross swords?
dlga_lord_denounce_4:lord_respond_to_insult_challenge_duel_confirm|It would be a pleasure to fight you.
dlga_lord_denounce_4:lord_denounce_retract|I spoke rashly. I retract my words.

dlga_dplmc_lord_internal_politics_plyr_request_support_2:lord_pretalk|Given our relationship, I would prefer to keep my own counsel on this matter.

I could use my considerable influence to arrange a pardon for you, {playername},but there are some who see you as an enemy and will not be satisfied unless you pay tribute.All in all, you'd need to bring no less than {reg16} aurums to make any friends in {s4}.
dlga_lord_ask_pardon:lord_pretalk.4|I am in no position to offer you anything. You must speak to {s7}.
dlga_lord_ask_pardon:lord_ask_pardon_2.1|Yes... I have bigger worries than you or your followers. However, you have wronged my subjects, and wrongs demand compensation. For the sum of {reg16} aurums, I suppose that I could agree to grant you a pardon. What do you say?
dlga_lord_ask_pardon:lord_pretalk.5|I am sorry. I am in no position to offer you a pardon
dlga_lord_ask_pardon_2:lord_ask_pardon_tribue_accept|I have the money here. {reg16} aurums.
dlga_lord_ask_pardon_2:lord_ask_pardon_tribue_deny|I fear I cannot pay that much.
dlga_lord_ask_pardon_tribue_accept:close_window|Excellent, {playername}.I will use this to make amends to those you have wronged, and I will let it be known that you are no longer an enemy of the {s4}.
dlga_lord_ask_pardon_tribue_accept:close_window.1|Excellent, {playername}.I'll use the coin to smooth the feathers of those that can oppose your pardon, and I'm sure that word will soon spread that you are no longer an enemy of {s4}.
dlga_lord_ask_pardon_tribue_deny:lord_pretalk|Then there's nothing I can do for you, {playername}. No silver, no pardon.
dlga_lord_talk:lord_active_mission_1|About the task you gave me...
dlga_lord_talk:lord_switch_to_spouse|Let us discuss matters related to our household.
dlga_lord_switch_to_spouse:lord_pretalk|Let us wait until we are in a hall, {s0}, as it is difficult to deal with household inventories and such matters in the field.
dlga_lord_switch_to_spouse:spouse_talk|Certainly, {s0}
dlga_lord_talk:lord_request_mission_ask|Do you have any tasks for me?
dlga_lord_talk:combined_political_quests|Do you think we can work together to advance our standings in this realm?
dlga_combined_political_quests:lord_pretalk|I do not imagine that you and I have many mutual interests.
dlga_combined_political_quests:lord_pretalk.1|Hmm.. Perhaps we can discuss this matter in a more private setting, at a later date.
dlga_combined_political_quests:lord_pretalk.2|Hmm.. I do have an idea, but it would require you that you be free of controversy. If you were to wait some time without getting into any arguments with the other {s0} of our realm, perhaps we could proceed further.
dlga_lord_talk:lord_ask_resign_marshalship|I wish to resign the marshalship
dlga_lord_ask_resign_marshalship:lord_pretalk|So be it. I shall have to find someone else.
dlga_start:fight2.3|Ah, we knew you would come. Our scouts told us about you way before you came here. You see, there are many willing to topple the King, Torlan.
dlga_fight2:fight3.2|I don't care much about politics. But the king has promised me a great reward for your head. I think that is more than enough incentive.
dlga_fight3:close_window.2|Someday, you will understand. Torlan is not a good man. He has done more evils that you can comprehend. However, since it is a battle you want, I must comply.
dlga_lord_talk:victory1|I have defeated the renegades!
dlga_victory1:lord_talk|Congradulations, {playername}. This is more than I had ever hoped for. Here is your reward!
dlga_lord_talk:renegades|I have heard news of a group of renegade noble in the kingdom. Is there anything I may do to help?
dlga_renegades:renegades1|Yes. I was going to address the kingdom about it, but then I decided that it could wait. They are a very dangerous bunch, and I thought that I had to deal with them myself.
dlga_renegades1:renegades2|I want to help you defeat them, my lord.
dlga_renegades2:renegades3|Do you?! I am impressed, {playername}. If you truly want to defeat them for me ... then ... then, well, I will reward you most handsomely should you succeed.
dlga_renegades3:renegades4|Where are they, my lord?
dlga_renegades4:close_window|I do not know. They may be anywhere in Tolranian lands. However, they are dangerous, so be very careful, warrior.
dlga_renegades1:close_window|Well, good luck, my lord.
dlga_lord_talk:priest1|My lord, I have heard that there are those who want to dispute your rule. Is there anything I could do to help?
dlga_priest1:priest2|You've heard, have you? Yes, there are many who want to dispute my rule. Which group are you talking about...?
dlga_priest2:priest3|Well, I've heard rumors recently that a Sectarian group of Dragon Priests have been wrecking havoc in Reich lands.
dlga_priest2:close_window|Nevermind ...
dlga_priest3:priest4|Ah, those bastards. Yes... you may be able to help me do something about them.
dlga_priest4:priest5|Where are they at?
dlga_priest5:close_window|Currently I do not know where those rats are. But, if you do find them, kill them for me and spit on their dead bodies.
dlga_start:fight2.4|So, the Kaiser's dog has come to sniff us out, eh?
dlga_fight2:fight3.3|The only dog here is you, my friend.
dlga_fight3:fight4|The Kaiser talks about a new future in this land, and hopes for a land united under his rule. He is foolish, very foolish, for that. He thinks that he is the one that can raise the Reich to glory. He has deluded himself in his visions for power. We were the first ones to see that, and have decided to break away.
dlga_fight4:fight4|He acts noble and supposedly upholds duty, but he is a hypocrite. All the nobles and kings are alike. Truly, you must realize that. You are smarter than them. If you defeat us, all you will get from the Kaiser is a pat on the back and a little reward for your loyalty. Is not freedom better than that?
dlga_fight4:close_window|If I do plan to break away, it certainly will not be with the likes of you. To arms!
dlga_lord_talk:victory1.1|I have defeated the Sectarians, my lord.
dlga_victory1:lord_talk.1|That is pleasing news, {playername}. Thank you for your time and effort. As promised, here is your reward.
dlga_lord_talk:rebeltribe1|I have heard that there was a rebel tribe that has been causing trouble in the area.
dlga_rebeltribe1:rebeltribe2|Ah, you've heard?! I did not think it to be a big deal.
dlga_rebeltribe2:rebeltribe3|Well is there anything I can do to help?
dlga_rebeltribe3:rebeltribe4|Of course. You can defeat them for me. I will reward you well. I don't know where they are hiding at the moment so you'll have to root them out.
dlga_rebeltribe4:close_window|Good idea. I will start immediately.
dlga_rebeltribe4:close_window.1|Maybe another time, my lord.
dlga_lord_talk:victory1.2|I have defeated the rebels, my lord.
dlga_victory1:lord_talk.2|That is pleasing news, {playername}. Thank you for your time and effort. As promised, here is your reward.
dlga_start:fight2.5|So, the foolish Sultan sends his little pet. How kind of you to come.
dlga_fight2:fight3.4|It took me a long time finding you cowards. Time to die!
dlga_fight3:close_window.3|Very well. I shall grant you your wish. I had hoped you would be more reasonable, but you give us no choice but to destroy you.
dlga_lord_talk:nworshippers1|Are there any challenging tasks for me to do?
dlga_nworshippers1:nworshippers2|Yes, {playername}. I'm glad you asked. There has been a large gathering of New Gods Worshippers who have been wreaking havoc in the countryside. Can you dispose of them for me? They are very dangerous.
dlga_nworshippers2:nworshippers3|Of course!
dlga_nworshippers3:nworshippers4|I will reward you well. I do not know their whereabouts at the moment so you will need to locate them by yourself.
dlga_nworshippers4:close_window|I will start immediately.
dlga_nworshippers4:close_window.1|Maybe another time, my lord.
dlga_lord_talk:congrats|I've defeated the tribe of Draharans!
dlga_congrats:lord_talk|That is great work! I'm truly impressed. Here, your reward, as promised.
dlga_start:fight2.6|Did that fool of a King send you? More to kill, I guess.
dlga_fight2:fight3.5|It took me a long time finding you cowards. Time to die!
dlga_fight3:close_window.4|I will enjoy sending your head to the king once we kill you.
dlga_lord_talk:mysteryquest1|Hello, Linthdrandil. Has anything of importance come by you recently?
dlga_mysteryquest1:mysteryquest2|Hello, my friend. Indeed, something of importance has. It is in fact a matter of great urgency. I found a portrait, which I believe belongs to King Greavth, one of the great Elintoran kings. My mother, Arwen, in particular, loves collecting treasures, and she would love the portrait.
dlga_mysteryquest2:mysteryquest3|That's great news! How, if I may ask, is this a matter of great urgency?
dlga_mysteryquest3:mysteryquest4|It's been stolen! The portrait was right under my grasp, but it was stolen! And I have no idea who did it! And now, my mother is coming to see me soon because she wants to see the portrait. She's bringing the council with her! It would be much too embarassing if I said it was stolen, under my very nose!
dlga_mysteryquest4:mysteryquest5|So, how am I going to come into this?
dlga_mysteryquest5:mysteryquest6|Please, help me find it! I suggest that you first go to Lord Throthradien, whom I suspect knows a thing or two about it. He was the only one I told.
dlga_mysteryquest6:lord_talk|Alright. I will do it.
dlga_lord_talk:aftermath1|I haven't found anything during my investigations.
dlga_aftermath1:aftermath2|That's okay. I have! I've found out that the entire thing was a ploy. The assassins were acting on their own accord. This was told to me by an anonymous informant.
dlga_aftermath2:aftermath3|And??? What happened?
dlga_aftermath3:aftermath4|It turns out that this was all a delicate plan to assassinate the Queen. The portrait is fake. However, the queen would like to talk to you.
dlga_aftermath4:lord_talk|Okay. All that was ... for nothing? - You think, what does the queen possibly want with you?-
dlga_lord_talk:reward1|I'm here, Your Majesty.
dlga_reward1:reward2|It's about time! I think I should reward you for your efforts. Linthrandil told me that you thwarted a delicate plan to assassinate me, by killing those assassins and through your interrogations.
dlga_reward2:reward3|Thank you, Your Majesty.
dlga_reward3:lord_talk|I shall not forget your favor. Goodbye, for now.
dlga_lord_talk:interrogation|-You lean close to the count until your voice is almost a whisper- Do you know anything about a missing portrait of King Greavth?
dlga_interrogation:interrogation1|-He looks shocked for a minute, and his face turns pale- Yes, I do. I ... I - they made me do it- steal the portrait! They were terrible..those men. 
dlga_interrogation1:interrogation2|Who? I need a name! Tell me who did it?
dlga_interrogation2:interrogation3|Men in red hoods... terrifying. They moved swifty like death itself.
dlga_interrogation3:interrogation4|Can you give any more information than that??
dlga_interrogation4:interrogation5|Those men ... thy were like assassins. They had red cloaks as well. I don't know what they wanted from me! I had to do it, or they would have killed me.
dlga_interrogation5:lord_talk|Thank you. You have been most helpful.
dlga_start:cult1|Halt! Tell me what you and your order know about a missing portrait, and what were you doing with it?
dlga_cult1:close_window|What? We are never told anything. A man named Zaos hired us for that. But, why did I just tell you that? I guess it was because we always tell our victims our plans before we kill them - it's quite a nice tradition, too!
dlga_lord_talk:interrogate1|I've caught you, Zaos! Come peacefully with me to the Queen. We know what you've done, villain!
dlga_interrogate1:interrogate2|Uh... what? What have I done? Fool, what the heck are you talking about? Are you trying to frame a lord of the Elintoran Nation?
dlga_interrogate2:interrogate3|Don't play stupid. Come with me peacefully or die.
dlga_interrogate3:interrogate4|I really do not know what you are talking about. I swear it on my life.
dlga_interrogate4:interrogate5|Uh... are you serious?? Then those assassins were lying! Gah, I knew I shouldn't have listened to them.
dlga_interrogate5:lord_talk|Well... I have no idea what you are talking about, but I guess I'll leave it alone. You're lucky I'm in a good mood today. Goodbye.
dlga_lord_talk:tlegion1|Are there any challenging tasks for me to do?
dlga_tlegion1:tlegion2|Yes, {playername}. There is a group of Hakkon Eite Deserters that have joined the Third Legion. They are now fleeing somewhere and are very dangerous.  Can you help me defeat them?
dlga_tlegion2:tlegion3|Of course!
dlga_tlegion3:tlegion4|I will reward you well. I do not know their whereabouts at the moment so you will need to locate them by yourself.
dlga_tlegion4:close_window|I will start immediately.
dlga_tlegion4:close_window.1|Maybe another time, my lord.
dlga_lord_talk:victory1.3|I have defeated the deserters, my lord.
dlga_victory1:lord_talk.3|That is pleasing news, {playername}. Thank you for your time and effort. As promised, here is your reward.
dlga_start:fight2.7|Don't try to stop us, fool. We are joining the ranks of the Third Legion, where we will have eternal glory!
dlga_fight2:fight3.6|It took me a long time finding you cowards. Time to die!
dlga_fight3:close_window.5|We warned you.
dlga_lord_talk:rebelhuscarls1|Are there any challenging tasks for me to do?
dlga_rebelhuscarls1:rebelhuscarls2|Yes, {playername}. There is a group of Rebel Huscarls that are causing trouble. They are now fleeing somewhere and are very dangerous.  Can you help me defeat them?
dlga_rebelhuscarls2:rebelhuscarls3|Of course!
dlga_rebelhuscarls3:rebelhuscarls4|I will reward you well. I do not know their whereabouts at the moment so you will need to locate them by yourself.
dlga_rebelhuscarls4:close_window|I will start immediately.
dlga_rebelhuscarls4:close_window.1|Maybe another time, my lord.
dlga_lord_talk:victory1.4|I have defeated the huscarls, my lord.
dlga_victory1:lord_talk.4|That is pleasing news, {playername}. Thank you for your time and effort. As promised, here is your reward.
dlga_start:fight2.8|So the King sent you, eh? He could have at least given us a challenge.
dlga_fight2:fight3.7|It took me a long time finding you cowards. Time to die!
dlga_fight3:close_window.6|Ha-ha! What a joke! I will enjoy crushing you!
dlga_lord_talk:lord_ask_enter_service|{s66}, I have come to offer you my sword in vassalage!
dlga_lord_talk:lord_ask_enter_service.1|{s66}, I wish to become your sworn {reg33?woman:man} and fight for your honour.
dlga_lord_talk:lord_ask_leave_service|{s66}, I wish to be released from my oath to you.
dlga_lord_talk:lord_talk_preoffer|I have an offer for you.
dlga_lord_talk:lord_give_troops|I want to give some troops to you.
dlga_lord_give_troops:lord_pretalk|I can't accomodate any more {reg65?soldiers:men} right now.  My supply lines are overtaxed as it is.
dlga_lord_give_troops:lord_pretalk.1|I have plenty of soldiers at the moment, but I suppose I could accomodate a few more.
dlga_lord_give_troops:lord_pretalk.2|Well, I could use some good soldiers. Thank you.
dlga_lord_talk:lord_give_order_ask|I have a new task for you.
dlga_lord_talk:lord_give_suggestion_ask|May I suggest a course of action?
dlga_lord_give_order_ask:lord_give_order|Yes?
dlga_lord_give_suggestion_ask:lord_give_order|I will gladly follow your direction, {reg33?your Highness:Sire}. If you intend to direct an extensive campaign, however, you may also wish to declare yourself marshal, so there is no cause for confusion.
dlga_lord_give_suggestion_ask:lord_pretalk|My apologies. I don't know you well enough to take your advice.
dlga_lord_give_suggestion_ask:lord_give_order.1|What is it?
dlga_lord_give_order:lord_give_order_answer|Follow me.
dlga_lord_give_order:lord_give_order_answer.1|Will you follow me? I have a plan...
dlga_lord_give_order:lord_give_order_details_ask|Go to...
dlga_lord_give_order:lord_give_order_details_ask.1|Raid around the village of...
dlga_lord_give_order:lord_give_order_details_ask.2|Patrol around...
dlga_lord_give_order:lord_give_order_assault|Together, you and I can take {s11}. You should assault immediately...
dlga_lord_give_order:lord_give_order_details_ask.3|We are under attack, but the enemy can be repulsed. You should ride towards...
dlga_lord_give_order:lord_give_order_details_ask.4|We are under attack, but the enemy can be repulsed. You should assemble the army and march to...
dlga_lord_give_order_assault:lord_pretalk|{s4} is directing this siege. I suggest you speak to {reg4?her:him}
dlga_lord_give_order_assault:lord_pretalk.1|Our preparations are not yet ready. We need another {s11}
dlga_lord_give_order_assault:close_window|Very well -- to the walls!
dlga_lord_give_order:lord_give_order_details_ask.5|There is a fortress which can easily be taken. Go to..
dlga_lord_give_order:lord_give_order_details_ask.6|The enemy is coming in force. Flee in the direction of...
dlga_lord_give_order:lord_give_order_stop|I won't need you for some time. You are free to do as you like.
dlga_lord_give_order:lord_give_order_stop.1|You no longer need to accompany me.
dlga_lord_give_order:lord_pretalk|Never mind.
dlga_lord_give_order_details_ask:lord_pretalk|It is not my way to turn tail and run, without even laying eyes on the enemy.
dlga_lord_give_order_details_ask:lord_pretalk.1|You want me to shed my blood outside a fortress while others stand by and watch? I think not.
dlga_lord_give_order_details_ask:lord_give_order_details|Where?
dlga_lord_give_order_details:lord_give_order_answer|{s1}
dlga_lord_give_order_details:lord_pretalk|Never mind.
dlga_lord_give_order_stop:lord_pretalk|All right. I will stop here.
dlga_lord_give_order_answer:lord_give_order|That would hardly be proper. It would be more appropriate for you to follow me instead. Did you have any other ideas?
dlga_lord_give_order_answer:lord_pretalk|All right. I will do that.{s12}
dlga_lord_give_order_answer:lord_pretalk.1|I am sorry. I need to attend my own business at the moment.
dlga_lord_start:lord_talk.5|What is it?
dlga_lord_talk:lord_give_order_call_to_arms_verify|I want to start a new campaign. Let us assemble the army here.
dlga_lord_give_order_call_to_arms_verify:lord_give_order_call_to_arms_verify_2|You wish to summon all lords for a new campaign?
dlga_lord_give_order_call_to_arms_verify_2:lord_give_order_call_to_arms|Yes. We must gather all our forces before we march on the enemy.
dlga_lord_give_order_call_to_arms_verify_2:lord_pretalk|On second thought, it won't be necessary to summon everyone.
dlga_lord_give_order_call_to_arms:lord_pretalk|All right then. I will send messengers and tell everyone to come here.
dlga_lord_talk:lord_give_order_disband_army_verify|I want to end the campaign and let everyone return home.
dlga_lord_give_order_disband_army_verify:lord_give_order_disband_army_2|You want to end the current campaign and release all lords from duty?
dlga_lord_give_order_disband_army_2:lord_give_order_disband_army|Yes. We no longer need all our forces here.
dlga_lord_give_order_disband_army_2:lord_pretalk|On second thought, it will be better to stay together for now.
dlga_lord_give_order_disband_army:lord_pretalk|All right. I will let everyone know that they are released from duty.
dlga_lord_talk:lord_talk_ask_something|I wish to ask you something.
dlga_lord_talk_ask_something:lord_talk_ask_something_2|Aye? What is it?
dlga_lord_talk_ask_something_2:lord_talk_ask_skill|Have your skills increased since the days when we were travelling companions?

dlga_lord_talk_ask_something_2:lord_talk_ask_location|I want to know the location of someone.
dlga_lord_talk_ask_something_2:lord_talk_ask_skills|I would like to know more about you and your skills.
dlga_lord_talk_ask_skills:lord_pretalk|Well, all right.
dlga_lord_talk_ask_something_2:lord_tell_objective|What are you and your men doing?
dlga_lord_talk_ask_something_2:lord_talk_ask_about_strategy|What is the realm doing?
dlga_lord_talk_ask_about_strategy:lord_pretalk|You should decide that, as you are the marshal.
dlga_lord_talk_ask_something_2:lord_reinf_settings|I wish to talk to you about soldiers you train.
dlga_lord_reinf_settings:lord_reinf_settings_branch|What exactly do you want, {playername}?
dlga_lord_reinf_settings_branch:lord_culture_switch_reply|I want you to start training troops of the culture of my kingdom.
dlga_lord_culture_switch_reply:lord_pretalk|That shall be done, {playername}.
dlga_lord_reinf_settings_branch:lord_culture_switch_back|I want you to return to training troops of your culture.
dlga_lord_culture_switch_back:lord_pretalk|That shall be done, {playername}.
dlga_lord_reinf_settings_branch:lord_use_freelancers|I want you to sign the contract with the Freelancer Guild and start recruiting their soldiers.
dlga_lord_use_freelancers:lord_pretalk|Well, if that's what you wish...
dlga_lord_reinf_settings_branch:lord_dont_use_freelancers|I want you to terminate your contract with the Freelancer Guild and stop using their soldiers.
dlga_lord_dont_use_freelancers:lord_pretalk|Well, if that's what you wish...
dlga_lord_reinf_settings_branch:lord_use_playersmercs|I want you to start training the same soldiers that are trained for me by the Mercenary Guild.
dlga_lord_use_playersmercs:lord_pretalk|All right, if you insist...
dlga_lord_reinf_settings_branch:lord_dont_use_playersmercs|I no longer want you to use mercenaries.
dlga_lord_dont_use_playersmercs:lord_pretalk|All right, if you say so...
dlga_lord_reinf_settings_branch:lord_reinf_settings_branch_back|Never mind.
dlga_lord_reinf_settings_branch_back:lord_pretalk|All right. Is there something else?
dlga_lord_talk_ask_something_2:lord_talk_ask_about_war|How goes the war?
dlga_lord_talk_ask_something_2:lord_change_equipment|CHEAT! I would like to see your equipment.

dlga_lord_marriage_permission:lord_pretalk|Great heaven, man -- if I haven't given you permission to see her, do you think I'm going to give you permission to marry her?
dlga_lord_marriage_permission:lord_pretalk.1|It is not my way to push my {s11} to marry against her will or her better judgment
dlga_lord_marriage_permission:lord_pretalk.2|Sorry, lad -- I'm not going to make my {s11} marry you, when I'd rather see her married to {s12}
dlga_lord_marriage_permission:lord_marriage_permission_endowment|Splendid news, my young man -- I shall be proud to have you in our family. Now, let us talk the terms of the marriage. As per our custom, the two of us must make sure that {s11} has sufficient finances to support herself, in the event of any unforeseen circumstances..
dlga_lord_marriage_permission_endowment:lord_marriage_permission_endowment_answer|I would say that, taking into consideration the prestige of our two houses, that you can provide a dower of {reg3} aurums, while I will supply a dowry of {reg4} aurums. This shall be her ladyship's property, as a security, lest for any reason you are unable to provide for her. What say you to that?
dlga_lord_marriage_permission_endowment_answer:lord_marriage_permission_engagement_date|Very well -- so let it be.
dlga_lord_marriage_permission_endowment_answer:lord_marriage_permission_endowment_answer_delay|I cannot afford that right now.

dlga_lord_strategy_follow_evaluation:lord_strategy_follow_up|Our leader {s4} is far too cautious. {reg4?She:He} should either use the army to attack the enemy, or let it go home.
dlga_lord_strategy_follow_evaluation:lord_strategy_follow_up.1|Our army sits, doing nothing. Apparently, too few vassals have answered the call to arms. Perhaps {s4} does not enjoy the confidence of the great lords of this realm.
dlga_lord_strategy_follow_evaluation:lord_strategy_follow_up.2|I disagree with this strategy. I would prefer to {s4}.

dlga_lord_strategy_follow_evaluation:lord_strategy_follow_up.4|I personally would prefer to defend {s8}, instead of {s9}.

dlga_lord_talk_replace_marshal:lord_talk_ask_something_again|I believe that our realm should resolve the issue of {s4} before we begin to debate replacing the marshal.
dlga_lord_talk_replace_marshal:lord_talk_ask_something_again.1|Yes. I have already made my position on this matter clear. I believe that {s4} should be marshal instead of {s5}.

dlga_lord_talk_replace_marshal_decision:lord_talk_ask_something_again.1|Not necessarily. It is possible for {s4} and I have to have an honest disagreement over strategy, without my seeking to replace him.

dlga_lord_ask_leave_service:lord_ask_leave_service_verify|Hrm.Has your oath become burdensome, {playername}? It is unusual to request release from homage,but in respect of your fine service, I will not hold you if you truly wish to end it.Though you would be sorely missed.
dlga_lord_ask_leave_service:lord_ask_leave_service_verify.1|Release from homage? Hmm, perhaps it would be for the best...However, {playername}, you must be sure that release is what you desire. This is not a thing done lightly.
dlga_lord_ask_leave_service_verify:lord_ask_leave_service_2|It is something I must do, {s65}.
dlga_lord_ask_leave_service_verify:lord_ask_leave_service_giveup|You are right, {s65}. My place is here.
dlga_lord_ask_leave_service_giveup:lord_pretalk|I am pleased to hear it, {playername}.I hope you'll banish such unworthy thoughts from your mind from now on.
dlga_lord_ask_leave_service_2:lord_ask_leave_service_verify_again|Then you are sure? Also, be aware that if you leave my services, you will be surrendering to me all the fiefs which you hold in my name.

dlga_lord_active_mission_1:lord_pretalk|{playername}, I must beg your patience, I still have need of your companion. Please return later when things have settled.
dlga_lord_active_mission_1:lord_active_mission_2|Yes, have you made any progress on it?
dlga_lord_active_mission_2:lord_generic_mission_thank|Indeed. I brought you {reg1} {s1} as prisoners.
dlga_lord_active_mission_2:capture_enemy_hero_thank|Oh, indeed. I've captured a lord from {s13} for you.
dlga_capture_enemy_hero_thank:capture_enemy_hero_thank_2|Many thanks, my friend. He will serve very well for a bargain. You've done a fine work here. Please accept these {reg5} aurums for your help.
dlga_capture_enemy_hero_thank_2:lord_pretalk|Certainly, {s65}.
dlga_capture_enemy_hero_thank_2:lord_pretalk.1|It was nothing.
dlga_capture_enemy_hero_thank_2:lord_pretalk.2|Give me more of a challenge next time.
dlga_lord_active_mission_2:lord_raise_troops_thank|Indeed. I have raised {reg1} {s13}. You can take them.
dlga_lord_raise_troops_thank:lord_raise_troops_thank_2|These men may well turn the tide in my plans, {playername}. I am confident you've trained them well. My thanks and my compliments to you.
dlga_lord_raise_troops_thank_2:lord_pretalk|Well, the lads are at your command now, sir. I am sure you will take good care of them.
dlga_lord_active_mission_2:lord_collect_taxes_success|Here are all the taxes from {s3}. It comes up to {reg19} aurums.
dlga_lord_active_mission_2:lord_collect_taxes_half_success|Here are the taxes from {s3}. It comes up to {reg19} aurums.
dlga_lord_active_mission_2:lord_collect_taxes_fail|Unfortunately, a revolt broke up while I was collecting the taxes. I could only collect {reg19} aurums.
dlga_lord_collect_taxes_success:lord_pretalk|Well done, {playername}, very well done indeed! You were truly the right {reg33?woman:man} for the job. I promised you a fifth of the taxes, so that amounts to {reg21} aurums. If you give me {reg20} aurums, you may keep the difference. A good result for everyone, eh?
dlga_lord_collect_taxes_half_success:lord_pretalk|What?! Is this some scheme of yours, {playername}? That's less than half the taxes I'm owed! You have let them get away with murder as well as my money. What a farce! You can forget the money I promised you, I'm taking {reg20} aurums from what you collected, and you're lucky I'm leaving you a few coins for honour's sake.
dlga_lord_collect_taxes_fail:lord_pretalk|God, what a bloody mess you've gotten us into, {playername}.This could turn very ugly if I do not take immediate action.I certainly hope you're not here expecting to be paid for failure.Hand over my {reg19} aurums, if you please, and end our business together.
dlga_lord_active_mission_2:lord_hunt_down_fugitive_success|I found {s4} hiding at {s3} and gave him his punishment.
dlga_lord_active_mission_2:lord_hunt_down_fugitive_fail|I'm afraid he got away.
dlga_lord_hunt_down_fugitive_success:lord_hunt_down_fugitive_success_2|And we'll all be a lot better off without him! Thank you, {playername}, for removing this long-festering thorn from my side. 'Tis good to know you can be trusted to handle things with an appropriate level of tactfulness. A bounty I promised, and a bounty you shall have. 300 aurums and not a copper less!
dlga_lord_hunt_down_fugitive_success_2:lord_hunt_down_fugitive_reward_accept|Let me take the money, {s65}. Thank you.
dlga_lord_hunt_down_fugitive_success_2:lord_hunt_down_fugitive_reward_reject|This is blood money. I can't accept it.
dlga_lord_hunt_down_fugitive_reward_accept:lord_pretalk|Of course, {playername}. Here you are. Once again, you've my thanks for ridding me of that {s43}.
dlga_lord_hunt_down_fugitive_reward_reject:lord_pretalk|You are a {reg33?woman:man} for whom justice is its own reward, eh? As you wish it, {playername}, as you wish it. An honourable sentiment, to be true. Regardless, you've my thanks for ridding me of that {s43}.
dlga_lord_hunt_down_fugitive_fail:lord_pretalk|It is a sad day when that {s43} manages to avoid the hand of justice yet again. I thought you would be able to do this, {playername}. Clearly I was wrong.
dlga_lord_active_mission_2:lord_active_mission_3|I am still working on it.
dlga_lord_active_mission_2:lord_mission_failed|I am afraid I won't be able to do this quest.
dlga_lord_active_mission_3:lord_pretalk|Good. Remember, I am counting on you.
dlga_lord_mission_failed:lord_pretalk|{s43}
dlga_lord_cheat_ask_for_rel_with_liege:lord_pretalk|It's {reg0}.
dlga_lord_suggets_attack_enemy_castle3:lord_pretalk|That should be possible. Very well, we'll attack {s1}.
dlga_lord_propose_mercenary:lord_mercenary_service|As it happens, {playername}, I promised {s10} that I would hire a company of mercenaries for an upcoming campaign.
dlga_lord_mercenary_service:lord_mercenary_service_reject|I'm not interested, but thank you for the offer
dlga_lord_mercenary_service:lord_mercenary_service_accept|Aye, this sounds good to me. I'll join {s9}.
dlga_lord_mercenary_service:lord_mercenary_elaborate_pay|I'm interested. Please tell me more about your offer.
dlga_lord_mercenary_service_accept:lord_mercenary_service_verify|Perfect. Of course you shall have to make a formal declaration of allegiance, and give your oath that you and your company will remain in service to {s9} for a period of no less than one month.
dlga_lord_mercenary_service_verify:lord_mercenary_service_verify_2|As you wish. Your enemies are my enemies.
dlga_lord_mercenary_service_verify:lord_mercenary_service_reject|On second thought, forget it.
dlga_lord_mercenary_service_verify_2:lord_mercenary_service_accept_3|That will do. You've made a wise choice, my friend. {s9} does well by its loyal fighters, you will receive many rewards for your service.
dlga_lord_mercenary_service_accept_3:lord_pretalk|Now, I suggest you prepare for a serious campaign. Train and equip your soldiers as best you can in the meantime, and respond quickly when you are summoned for duty.
dlga_lord_mercenary_service_reject:lord_pretalk|I'm very sorry to hear that. You'll find no better place than {s9}, be sure of that.
dlga_lord_mercenary_elaborate_pay:lord_mercenary_elaborate_1|I can offer you a contract for one month. At the end of this period, it can be extended on a monthly basis. An initial sum of {reg12} aurums will be paid to you to seal the contract. After that, you'll receive wages from {s10} each week, according to the number and quality of the soldiers in your company. You still have your rights to battlefield loot and salvage, as well as any prisoners you capture. War can be very profitable at times...
dlga_lord_mercenary_service_elaborate_duty:lord_mercenary_elaborate_1|Duties... There are only a few, none of them difficult. The very first thing is to declare your allegiance. An oath of loyalty to our cause. Once that's done, you shall be required to fulfill certain responsibilities. You'll participate in military campaigns, fulfill any duties given to you by your commanders, and most of all you shall attack the enemies of our kingdom wherever you might find them.
dlga_lord_mercenary_elaborate_1:lord_mercenary_service_elaborate_duty|And what about my duties as a mercenary?
dlga_lord_mercenary_elaborate_1:lord_mercenary_elaborate_castle|Can I hold on to any castles I take?
dlga_lord_mercenary_elaborate_1:lord_mercenary_elaborate_banner|Can I fly my own banner?
dlga_lord_mercenary_elaborate_1:lord_mercenary_elaborate_pay|How much will you pay me for my service?
dlga_lord_mercenary_elaborate_1:lord_mercenary_service_accept|Sounds good. I wish to enter your service as a mercenary.
dlga_lord_mercenary_elaborate_1:lord_mercenary_service_reject|Apologies, my sword is not for hire.
dlga_lord_mercenary_elaborate_castle:lord_mercenary_elaborate_1|Only my loyal vassals can own lands and castles in my realm -- and all my vassals are {reg65?men:women}. I am not inclined to depart from this tradition without a very good reason. If you prove yourself in battle, you can swear an oath of homage to me and become my vassal. We may then discuss how you may obtain a castle.
dlga_lord_mercenary_elaborate_castle:lord_mercenary_elaborate_1.1|Hmm... Only loyal vassals of {s10} can own lands and castles. While {s0} will sometimes accept vassalage from {reg33?women:men} who prove themselves in battle, and grant them land, I have never heard of a {s1} who gave fiefs to {reg33?women:men}. You had best discuss that issue with {s10} {reg0?herself:himself}.
dlga_lord_mercenary_elaborate_castle:lord_mercenary_elaborate_1.2|Only my loyal vassals can own lands and castles in my realm. A mercenary can not be trusted with such a responsibility. However, after serving for some time, you can swear homage to me and become my vassal. Then you will be rewarded with a fief.
dlga_lord_mercenary_elaborate_castle:lord_mercenary_elaborate_1.3|Only loyal vassals of {s10} can own lands and castles. You understand, a simple mercenary cannot be trusted with such responsibility. However, after serving for some time, you may earn the right to swear homage to {s10} and become {reg0?her:his} vassal. Then you would be rewarded with a fief.
dlga_lord_mercenary_elaborate_banner:lord_mercenary_elaborate_1|Only my noble vassals have the honour of carrying their own banners. However, after some time in mercenary service, you may earn the opportunity to swear homage to me and become my vassal, gaining the right to choose a banner of your own and fight under it in battle.
dlga_lord_mercenary_elaborate_banner:lord_mercenary_elaborate_1.1|Only noble vassals of {s10} have the honour of carrying their own banners. However, after some time of mercenary service, perhaps you can earn the opportunity to swear homage to {s10} and become {reg0?her:his} vassal, gaining the right to choose a banner of your own and fight under it in battle.
dlga_lord_request_mission_ask:lord_pretalk|You still haven't finished the last job I gave you, {playername}. You should be working on that, not asking me for other things to do.
dlga_lord_request_mission_ask:lord_pretalk.1|I don't have any other jobs for you right now.
dlga_lord_request_mission_ask:lord_tell_mission|A task?
dlga_lord_request_mission_ask:lord_pretalk.2|My {reg33?Lady:Lord}, by the traditions of courtship, I should be offering my services to you. Unfortunately, I have little time right now, so I beg you to take this declaration of my esteem in its place.
dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_tell_mission_sworn_vassal|There are some minor errands which I need completed, but it would be more appropriate to give them to one of my own {reg65?servants:men}, not to {reg0?my sworn liege:a sworn vassal of the realm}.
dlga_lord_tell_mission_sworn_vassal:lord_pretalk|If you are looking for action against our foes, you may join our attack on {s4}. The enemy may come in force to oppose us, so it is good to have as many {reg33?soldiers:men} as possible.
dlga_lord_tell_mission_sworn_vassal:lord_pretalk.1|If you are looking for action against our foes, you may try venturing out to {s4}. We have received word that a force of the {s5} is in the area, and I am going there myself. I cannot guarantee you that our enemies will be there when you arrive, of course.
dlga_lord_tell_mission_sworn_vassal:lord_pretalk.2|If you are looking for action against our foes, you may try venturing out to {s4}. We have received word that a force of the {s5} is in the area. I am not currently headed that way, but others may be.  I cannot guarantee you that our enemies will be there when you arrive, of course.
dlga_lord_tell_mission_sworn_vassal:lord_pretalk.3|If a worthy task presents itself, however, I may have a favor to ask of you at a later date.
dlga_lord_tell_mission:destroy_lair_quest_brief|Yes -- there is something you can do for us. We have heard reports that a group of {s4} have established a hideout in this area, and have been attacking travellers. If you could find their lair and destroy it, we would be very grateful.
dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_mission_rescue_prisoner|My {s11}, {s13}, has been taken prisoner by {s14} of the {s15}. Normally, honorable nobles will grant prisoners of gentle blood the privilege of parole, and treat them as honored guests so long as they give their word that they will not attempt to escape, until such time as a ransom can be paid.  But {s14}, instead of granting {s13} parole, has consigned my {s11} to {reg3?her:his} dungeons -- no doubt in the hope that {reg3?she:he} can demand more from us.
dlga_lord_mission_rescue_prisoner:lord_mission_rescue_prisoner_confirm|We need you to get my {s11} out of prison. You may be able to pay a ransom -- in which case we could cover your expenses, up to 5000 aurums. If you have connections within {s24}, you may be able to use them to sneak {reg4?her:him} out. Or, you may try a more direct approach -- walk up to the gaoler, take the keys by force, and then fight your way out. Can you do this for us?
dlga_lord_mission_rescue_prisoner_confirm:lord_mission_rescue_prisoner_accepted|I can try.
dlga_lord_mission_rescue_prisoner_confirm:lord_mission_rescue_prisoner_rejected|I don't think that I can help you.
dlga_lord_mission_rescue_prisoner_rejected:close_window|It would not have been an easy task. Perhaps we will find another way.
dlga_lord_mission_rescue_prisoner_accepted:lord_mission_rescue_prisoner_method|We are most grateful. Could I ask you how you were planning to proceed?
dlga_lord_mission_rescue_other_ideas:lord_mission_rescue_prisoner_method|Did you have any other ideas which you wished to discuss?
dlga_lord_mission_rescue_prisoner_method:lord_mission_rescue_prisoner_method_prisonbreak|I am thinking of breaking into the prison in {s24}, finding {s13}, and fighting my way out.
dlga_lord_mission_rescue_prisoner_method:lord_mission_rescue_prisoner_method_siege|I am thinking of taking {s24} by storm.
dlga_lord_mission_rescue_prisoner_method:lord_mission_rescue_prisoner_planning_end|I have done enough planning. Time to act!
dlga_lord_mission_rescue_prisoner_planning_end:close_window|May the heavens protect you.
dlga_lord_mission_rescue_prisoner_method_prisonbreak:lord_mission_rescue_prisoner_method_prisonbreak_2|I had discussed this idea with some of my men. One could enter {s24}, either in disguise or openly, then walk up to the prison guard and try to take the keys by force. However, getting out may be difficult. The garrison may be slow to react, but even so, you are likely to find yourself fighting a half dozen or more of the enemy at once, with limited space in which to maneuver. If you can fight your way past them, though, you can probably get out.
dlga_lord_mission_rescue_prisoner_method_prisonbreak_2:lord_mission_rescue_other_ideas|You may find it useful to create a distraction, to divert the attention of some of the garrison. If you have any connections in the villages near {s24}, this may be a time to put them to use.
dlga_lord_mission_rescue_prisoner_method_siege:lord_mission_rescue_other_ideas|Well, that is certainly the most direct approach.
dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_mission_deliver_message|I need to send a letter to {s13} who should be currently at {s4}. If you will be heading towards there, would you deliver it to {reg0?her:him}? The letter needs to be in {reg0?her:his} hands in 30 days.
dlga_lord_mission_deliver_message:lord_mission_deliver_message_accepted|Certainly, I intend to pass by {s4} and it would be no trouble.
dlga_lord_mission_deliver_message:lord_mission_deliver_message_rejected|I doubt I'll be seeing {s13} anytime soon, {s65}. You'd best send it with someone else.
dlga_lord_mission_deliver_message:lord_mission_deliver_message_rejected_rudely|I am no errand {reg33?girl:boy}, {reg65?my lady:sir}. Hire a courier for your trivialities.
dlga_lord_mission_deliver_message_accepted:close_window|I appreciate it, {playername}. Here's the letter, and a small sum to cover your travel expenses. Give my regards to {s13} when you see {reg0?her:him}.
dlga_lord_mission_deliver_message_rejected:lord_pretalk|Ah, all right then. Well, I am sure I will find someone else.
dlga_lord_mission_deliver_message_rejected_rudely:lord_mission_deliver_message_rejected_rudely_2|Hm, is this how you respond to a polite request for a small favor? A poor show, {playername}. I didn't know you would take offence.
dlga_lord_mission_deliver_message_rejected_rudely_2:lord_mission_deliver_message_rejected_rudely_3|Then you shall know better from now on.
dlga_lord_mission_deliver_message_rejected_rudely_2:lord_mission_deliver_message_accepted|Forgive my temper, {s65}. I'll deliver your letter.
dlga_lord_mission_deliver_message_rejected_rudely_3:close_window|All right. I will remember that.
dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_mission_deliver_love_letter|Ah, love. Have you ever been in love, {playername}? I have fallen for a lady. I saw {s13} at a banquet not long ago, and have thought of little else since... I must know if she feels the same way. Will you deliver this message for me?
dlga_lord_mission_deliver_love_letter:lord_mission_deliver_love_letter_accepted|Certainly, I will carry your message.
dlga_lord_mission_deliver_love_letter:lord_mission_deliver_love_letter_rejected|I doubt I'll be seeing {s13} anytime soon, {s65}. You'd best send it with someone else.
dlga_lord_mission_deliver_love_letter_accepted:lord_mission_deliver_love_letter1|I appreciate it, {playername}. Er, there's just one small snag. I'm not a literary man, and I suspect this type of thing is beyond me. You will have to help me write the note. Hmmm, let's see. How do you think I should start it off? I was thinking either, 'Greetings, wench,' or 'My love, my darling, I hunger for your touch'.
dlga_lord_mission_deliver_love_letter1:lord_mission_deliver_love_letter_2|Greetings, wench.
dlga_lord_mission_deliver_love_letter1:lord_mission_deliver_love_letter_2.1|My love, my darling, I hunger for your love.
dlga_lord_mission_deliver_love_letter1:lord_mission_deliver_love_letter_2.2|Er, how about, Dear Lady, I hope this letter finds you well.
dlga_lord_mission_deliver_love_letter_2:lord_mission_deliver_love_letter3|Excellent, I like it! Now, what next? ^'I could not help but notice your bustle at the ball,' 'Your fragile beauty excites my desires,' or 'I admire a woman with some meat on her bones'?

dlga_lord_mission_deliver_love_letter_4:lord_mission_deliver_love_letter5|Wonderful. Truly a masterpiece. And to conclude on a high note? ^How about, 'In truth, I love you more than my own horse.' No? Well, what about, 'Your beauty dazzles me like glare of the sun on an enemy shield.' Ahhh, I like that one.
dlga_lord_mission_deliver_love_letter5:lord_mission_deliver_love_letter_6|In truth, I love you more than my own horse.

dlga_lord_mission_deliver_love_letter5:lord_mission_deliver_love_letter_6.2|Maybe, your noble mien evokes a subtle mystery?
dlga_lord_mission_deliver_love_letter_6:close_window|I appreciate your help, {playername}. Here's the letter, and some money to cover your travel expenses. Ha ha! How can she resist?

dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_mission_told|There is a small thing... My {s17} {s13} is due for a visit to {reg4?her:his} relatives at {s14}.

dlga_lord_mission_raise_troops_rejected:lord_pretalk|Oh, of course. I had expected as much. Well, good luck to you then.
dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_mission_collect_taxes_told|You probably know that I am the lord of the {reg9?town:village} of {s3}.

dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_mission_hunt_down_fugitive_told|I have something you could help with, an issue with the lawless villain known as {s4}.  He murdered one of my men and has been on the run from his judgment ever since. I can't let him get away with avoiding justice, so I've put a bounty of 300 aurums on his head.

You might be able to hunt him down and give him what he deserves, and claim the bounty for yourself.
dlga_lord_mission_hunt_down_fugitive_told:lord_mission_hunt_down_fugitive_accepted|Then I will hunt him down and execute the law.
dlga_lord_mission_hunt_down_fugitive_told:lord_mission_hunt_down_fugitive_rejected|I am too busy to go after him at the moment.
dlga_lord_mission_hunt_down_fugitive_accepted:close_window|That's excellent, {playername}. I will be grateful to you and so will the family of the man he murdered. And of course the bounty on his head will be yours if you can get him. Well, good hunting to you.
dlga_lord_mission_hunt_down_fugitive_rejected:lord_pretalk|As you wish, {playername}.I suppose there are plenty of bounty hunters around to get the job done . . .
dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_mission_told_kill_local_merchant|The wretched truth is that I owe a considerable sum of money to one of the merchants here in {s3}. I've no intention of paying it back, of course, but that loud-mouthed fool is making a terrible fuss about it. He even had the audacity to come and threaten me -- me! -- with a letter of complaint to the trade guilds and bankers. Why, he'd ruin my good reputation! So I need a {reg33?woman:man} I can trust, someone who will guarantee the man's silence. For good.
dlga_lord_mission_told_kill_local_merchant:lord_mission_accepted_kill_local_merchant|Worry not, he shan't breathe a word.
dlga_lord_mission_told_kill_local_merchant:lord_mission_rejected|I'm no common murderer, sir. Find someone else for your dirty job.
dlga_lord_mission_accepted_kill_local_merchant:close_window|Very good. I trust in your skill and discretion, {playername}. Do not disappoint me. Go now and wait for my word, I'll send you a message telling when and where you can catch the merchant. Dispose of him for me and I shall reward you generously.
dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_mission_told_meet_spy_in_enemy_town|I have a sensitive matter which needs tending to, {playername}, and no trustworthy retainers to take care of it. The fact is that I have a spy in {s13} to keep an eye on things for me, and report anything that might warrant my attention. Every week I send someone to collect the spy's reports and bring them back to me. The job's yours if you wish it.
dlga_lord_mission_told_meet_spy_in_enemy_town:quest_meet_spy_in_enemy_town_accepted|I don't mind a bit of skullduggery. Count me in.
dlga_lord_mission_told_meet_spy_in_enemy_town:quest_meet_spy_in_enemy_town_rejected|I must decline. This cloak-and-dagger work isn't fit for me.
dlga_quest_meet_spy_in_enemy_town_accepted:quest_meet_spy_in_enemy_town_accepted_response|Excellent! Make your way to {s13} as soon as you can, the spy will be waiting.
dlga_quest_meet_spy_in_enemy_town_accepted_response:quest_meet_spy_in_enemy_town_accepted_2|{s13} is heavily defended. How can I get close without being noticed?
dlga_quest_meet_spy_in_enemy_town_accepted_2:quest_meet_spy_in_enemy_town_accepted_response|You shall have to use stealth. Take care to avoid enemy strongholds, villages and patrols, and don't bring too many men with you. If you fail to sneak in the first time, give it a while for the garrison to lower its guard again, or you may have a difficult time infiltrating the town.
dlga_quest_meet_spy_in_enemy_town_accepted_response:quest_meet_spy_in_enemy_town_accepted_3|How will I recognise the spy?
dlga_quest_meet_spy_in_enemy_town_accepted_3:quest_meet_spy_in_enemy_town_accepted_response|Once you get to {s13} you must talk to the locals, the spy will be one of them. If you think you've found the spy, say the phrase '{s11}' The spy will respond with the phrase '{s12}' Thus you will know the other, and {reg7?she:he} will give you any information {reg7?she:he}'s gathered in my service.
dlga_quest_meet_spy_in_enemy_town_accepted_response:quest_meet_spy_in_enemy_town_accepted_4|Will I be paid?
dlga_quest_meet_spy_in_enemy_town_accepted_4:quest_meet_spy_in_enemy_town_accepted_response|Of course, I have plenty of silver in my coffers for loyal {reg33?women:men} like you. Do well by me, {playername}, and you'll rise high.
dlga_quest_meet_spy_in_enemy_town_accepted_response:quest_meet_spy_in_enemy_town_accepted_end|I know what to do. Farewell, my lord.
dlga_quest_meet_spy_in_enemy_town_accepted_end:lord_pretalk|Good luck, {playername}. Remember, the secret phrase is '{s11}' The counterphrase is '{s12}' Bring any reports back to me, and I'll compensate you for your trouble.
dlga_quest_meet_spy_in_enemy_town_rejected:lord_pretalk|As you wish, {playername}, but I strongly advise you to forget anything I told you about any spies. They do not exist, have never existed, and no one will ever find them. Remember that.
dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_mission_told_raid_caravan_to_start_war|This peace with {s13} ill suits me, {playername}. We've let those swine have their way for far too long. Now they get stronger with each passing and their arrogance knows no bounds. I say, we must wage war on them before it's too late! Unfortunately, some of the bleeding hearts among our realm's lords are blocking a possible declaration of war. Witless cowards with no stomach for blood.
dlga_lord_mission_told_raid_caravan_to_start_war:lord_mission_tell_raid_caravan_to_start_war_2|You are right, {s65}, but what can we do?
dlga_lord_mission_told_raid_caravan_to_start_war:quest_raid_caravan_to_start_war_rejected_1|I disagree, sir. It is better that there be peace.
dlga_lord_mission_tell_raid_caravan_to_start_war_2:lord_mission_tell_raid_caravan_to_start_war_3|Ah, 'tis good to hear someone who understands! As a matter of fact, there is something we can do, {playername}. A little bit of provocation... If one of our war parties managed to enter their territory and pillage one of their caravans, or raided one of their villages, and perhaps left behind a little token or two of the {s14}, they would have ample cause to declare war on us. And then, well, even the cowards among us must rise to defend themselves. So what do you say? Are you interested?
dlga_lord_mission_tell_raid_caravan_to_start_war_3:quest_raid_caravan_to_start_war_accepted|An excellent plan. Count me in.
dlga_lord_mission_tell_raid_caravan_to_start_war_3:lord_mission_tell_raid_caravan_to_start_war_4|Why don't you do that yourself?
dlga_lord_mission_tell_raid_caravan_to_start_war_4:lord_mission_tell_raid_caravan_to_start_war_5|Well, {playername}, some of the lords in our kingdom won't like the idea of someone inciting a war without their consent. They are already looking for an excuse to get at me, and if I did this they could make me pay for it dearly. You, on the other hand, are young and well-liked and daring, so you might just get away with it. And of course I will back you up and defend your actions against your opponents. All in all, a few lords might be upset at your endeavour, but I am sure you won't be bothered with that.
dlga_lord_mission_tell_raid_caravan_to_start_war_5:quest_raid_caravan_to_start_war_accepted|That seems reasonable. I am willing to do this.
dlga_lord_mission_tell_raid_caravan_to_start_war_5:quest_raid_caravan_to_start_war_rejected_2|I don't like this. Find yourself someone else to take the blame for your schemes.
dlga_quest_raid_caravan_to_start_war_accepted:close_window|Very good! A raid on a caravan, or, if you can't manage that, an attack on one of their villages, should do the trick. Now, good luck and good hunting. Go set the borders aflame!
dlga_quest_raid_caravan_to_start_war_rejected_1:lord_pretalk|Ah, you think so? But how long will your precious peace last? Not long, believe me.
dlga_quest_raid_caravan_to_start_war_rejected_2:lord_pretalk|Hm. As you wish, {playername}. I thought you had some fire in you, but it seems I was wrong.
dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_mission_told.1|Well, some of the serfs working my fields in {s4} have run away. The ungrateful swine, I let them plough my fields and rent my cottages, and this is how they repay me! From what I've been hearing, they're running to {s3} as fast as they can, and have split up into three groups to try and avoid capture. I want you to capture all three groups and fetch them back to {s4} by whatever means necessary. I should really have them hanged for attempting to escape, but we need hands for the upcoming harvest, so I'll let them go off this time with a good beating.
dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_tell_mission_follow_spy|I have good information that a man in this very town is actually an enemy spy. He should be seized and hanged for his impudence, but we also believe that very soon he will leave town to meet with his master, the man to whom the spy feeds all his little whispers. The spy himself is of little import, but the master is a dangerous man, and could tell us a great deal if we could only get our hands on him...
dlga_lord_tell_mission_follow_spy:lord_tell_mission_follow_spy_2|I want you to wait here until the spy leaves town. Then you must follow him, stealthily, to the meeting place. You must take absolute care not to be seen by the spy on your way, else he may suspect foul play and turn back. When the master appears, you must ambush and arrest them and bring the pair back to me. Alive, if you please.
dlga_lord_tell_mission_follow_spy_2:lord_tell_mission_follow_spy_accepted|I'll do it, {s65}.
dlga_lord_tell_mission_follow_spy_2:lord_tell_mission_follow_spy_rejected|No, this skulking is not for me.
dlga_lord_tell_mission_follow_spy_accepted:close_window|Good, I'm sure you'll do a fine job of it. One of my men will point the spy out to you when he leaves, so you will know the man to follow. Remember, I want them both, and I want them alive.
dlga_lord_tell_mission_follow_spy_rejected:lord_pretalk|A shame. Well, carry on as you were, {playername}...
dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_tell_mission_capture_enemy_hero|There is a difficult job I need done, {playername}, and you may be the {reg33?woman:man} who can carry it off. I need someone to capture one of the noble lords of {s13} and bring him to me. Afterwards, I'll be able to exchange him in return for a relative of mine held by {s13}. It is a simple enough job, but whomever you choose will be guarded by an elite band of personal retainers. Are you up for a fight?
dlga_lord_tell_mission_capture_enemy_hero:lord_tell_mission_capture_enemy_hero_accepted|Consider it done, {s65}.
dlga_lord_tell_mission_capture_enemy_hero:lord_tell_mission_capture_enemy_hero_rejected|I must refuse, {s65}. I am not a kidnapper.
dlga_lord_tell_mission_capture_enemy_hero_accepted:close_window|I like your spirit! Go and bring me one of our enemies, and I'll toast your name in my hall when you return! And reward you for your efforts, of course...
dlga_lord_tell_mission_capture_enemy_hero_rejected:lord_pretalk|Clearly you lack the mettle I had thought you possessed. Very well, {playername}, I will find someone else.
dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_tell_mission_lend_companion|I don't have a job for you right now, but your companion {s3} is a skilled {reg3?lass:fellow} and I need someone with {reg3?her:his} talents. Will you lend {reg3?her:him} to me for a while?
dlga_lord_tell_mission_lend_companion:lord_tell_mission_lend_companion_2|How long will you be needing {reg3?her:him}?
dlga_lord_tell_mission_lend_companion_2:lord_mission_lend_companion_told|Just a few days, a week at most.
dlga_lord_mission_lend_companion_told:lord_tell_mission_lend_companion_accepted|Then I will leave {s3} with you for one week.
dlga_lord_mission_lend_companion_told:lord_tell_mission_lend_companion_rejected|I am sorry, but I cannot do without {s3} for a whole week.
dlga_lord_tell_mission_lend_companion_accepted:close_window|I cannot thank you enough, {playername}. Worry not, your companion shall be returned to you with due haste.
dlga_lord_tell_mission_lend_companion_rejected:lord_pretalk|Well, that's damned unfortunate, but I suppose I cannot force you or {s3} to agree. I shall have to make do without.
dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_tell_mission_collect_debt|Some time ago, I loaned out a considerable sum of money to {s3}. {reg4} aurums, to be precise. {reg0?She:He} was supposed to pay it back within a month but I haven't received a copper from {reg0?her:him} since. That was months ago. If you could collect the debt from {reg0?her:him} on my behalf, I would be grateful indeed. I would even let you keep one fifth of the money for your trouble. What do you say?
dlga_lord_tell_mission_collect_debt:lord_tell_mission_collect_debt_2|Do you know where I can find {s3}, {s65}?
dlga_lord_tell_mission_collect_debt_2:lord_tell_mission_collect_debt_3|If you leave now, you should be able to find {reg0?her:him} at {s4}. I've no doubt that {reg0?she:he} will be suitably embarassed by {reg0?her:his} conduct and give you all the money {reg0?she:he} owes me.
dlga_lord_tell_mission_collect_debt_3:lord_tell_mission_collect_debt_accepted|Then I will talk to {s3} on your behalf.
dlga_lord_tell_mission_collect_debt_3:lord_tell_mission_collect_debt_rejected|Forgive me, {s65}, but I doubt I would be more successful than yourself.
dlga_lord_tell_mission_collect_debt_accepted:close_window|You made me very happy by accepting this {playername}. Please, talk to {s3} and don't leave {reg0?her:him} without my money.
dlga_lord_tell_mission_collect_debt_rejected:lord_pretalk|Perhaps not, {playername}. I suppose I'm never getting that money back...
dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander|I tell you, that blubbering fool {s13} is not fit to rule {s14}. God knows {reg3?she:he} would be divested of {reg3?her:his} lands in an instant were it not for one of {reg3?her:his} loyal vassals, {s15}. As long as {reg3?she:he} has {reg3?her:his} vassal aiding {reg3?her:him}, it will be a difficult job beating {reg3?her:him}. So I need to get {s15} out of the picture, and I have a plan just to do that... With your help, naturally.
dlga_lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander:lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander_2|{s66}, I am all ears.
dlga_lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander:lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander_rejected|I don't wish to involve myself in anything dishonourable against {s15}.
dlga_lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander_rejected:lord_pretalk|Dishonourable? Bah! I was hoping I could count on you, {playername}, but you've shown me what a fool I was. I shall have to find someone whose loyalty I can trust.
dlga_lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander_2:lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander_3|I have written a fake letter to {s15}, bearing my own seal, which implicates {reg4?her:him} in a conspiracy with us to stage a coup in {s14}, in my favour. If we can make {s13} believe the letter is genuine, {reg3?she:he} will deal with {s15} very swiftly. Of course, the challenge there is to convince {s13} that the letter is indeed real...
dlga_lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander_3:lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander_4|Please continue, {s65}...
dlga_lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander_3:lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander_rejected|No, I will not sully myself with this dishonourable scheme.
dlga_lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander_4:lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander_5|This is where you come into play. You'll take the letter to {s14}, then give it to one of your soldiers and instruct him to take it to {s15}. I will have one of my spies inform the town garrison so that your man will be arrested on his way. The guards will then find the letter and take it to {s13}. They'll torture your man, of course, to try and get the truth out of him, but all he knows is that you ordered the letter to be delivered to {s15} under the utmost secrecy. {s13} knows you serve me, and the fool will certainly believe the whole charade.
dlga_lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander_5:lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander_7|Is that all?
dlga_lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander_7:lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander_8|There is one more thing... Your messenger must be someone trustworthy. If you sent the letter with a simple peasant, someone expendable, {s13} might suspect a plot. {reg3?She:He} may have the wits of a snail, but even a snail can see the obvious. Give the letter to someone of rank. One of your {s9}, perhaps.
dlga_lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander_8:lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander_9|What? I can't send one of my trusted {s9} to his death!
dlga_lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander_8:lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander_fin|Then a {s8} it will be.
dlga_lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander_9:lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander_10|Come now, {playername}. There is a place for sentimentality, but this is not it. Believe me, you shall be generously compensated, and what is the purpose of soldiers if not to die at our say-so?
dlga_lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander_10:lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander_fin|A {s8} it is.
dlga_lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander_10:lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander_rejected|No, I'll not sacrifice one of my chosen men.
dlga_lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander_fin:lord_pretalk|I can't tell you how pleased I am to hear that, {playername}. You are removing one of the greatest obstacles in my path. Here is the letter, as well as 300 aurums for your expenses. Remember, there'll be more once you succeed. Much, much more...
dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_mission_told.2|A group of my soldiers were captured in a recent skirmish with the enemy. Thankfully we have a mutual agreement of prisoner exchange, and they will release my men, but they want us to give them prisoners of equal rank and number. Prisoners I don't currently have. So, I need a good {reg33?warrior:man} to find me {reg1} {s3} as prisoners, that I may exchange them.
dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_pretalk|No {playername}. I do not need your help at this time.
dlga_lord_mission_told:lord_mission_accepted|You can count on me, {s65}.
dlga_lord_mission_told:lord_mission_rejected|I fear I cannot accept such a mission at the moment.
dlga_lord_mission_accepted:close_window|Excellent, {playername}, excellent. I have every confidence in you.
dlga_lord_mission_rejected:close_window|Is that so? Well, I suppose you're just not up to the task. I shall have to look for somebody with more mettle.

dlga_lord_persuade_to_join:close_window|Yes, {playername}, and in fact I hoped that you'd ask me this question. It seems to me that if I join your kingdom, that will be beneficial for both of us.
dlga_lord_persuade_to_join:close_window.1|Yes, {playername}, and in fact I hoped that you'd ask me this question. For a long time I have been hearing people talk about your noble deeds, and you have also proven to be an excellent leader. So now I consider it an honor to join you.
dlga_lord_persuade_to_join:close_window.2|Of course, {playername}. Together again, huh?
dlga_lord_persuade_to_join:lord_talk|No, {playername}. I am not sure I see any reasons for me to abandon my current oath and join you.

We may be enemies in this war, but I pray that you believe, as I do, that we can still be civil towards each other. Thus I hoped that you would be kind enough to assist me in something important to me.
dlga_lord_leave_give_quest:enemy_lord_tell_mission|I am listening.
dlga_enemy_lord_tell_mission:lord_mission_told|I have a friend here, an old warrior, who is very sick. Pestilence has infected an old battle wound, and unless he is seen to by a surgeon soon,  he will surely die.

I have heard that you've a capable surgeon with you. If you would let your surgeon come here and have a look, {reg3?she:he} may be able to convince him to give his consent to an operation.

dlga_spouse_organize_feast:spouse_pretalk|A splendid idea, {s0}. However, let us wait for the current feast here to conclude, before organizing another.
dlga_spouse_organize_feast:spouse_pretalk.1|A splendid idea, {s0}. However, we must establish a court before hosting a feast.
dlga_spouse_organize_feast:spouse_pretalk.2|A splendid idea, {s0}. However, our realm has recently had a feast. Perhaps we should wait another {reg3} days before we organize another one.
dlga_spouse_organize_feast:spouse_evaluate_larder_for_feast|A splendid idea, {s0}. However, to not insult our guests, we must make sure that we can provide a large and varied repast, for the lords, their families, and their retinues.

dlga_start:kingdom_lady_captive|So great is my loneliness! How I miss my family!
dlga_start:kingdom_lady_captive.1|You are a cad, {reg33?madame:sir}, to hold a {reg65?lady:free-spirited lad} like this...
dlga_start:kingdom_lady_captive.2|It is strange. On occasion you have shown me such kindness, and yet you continue to hold me here against my will.
dlga_start:kingdom_lady_captive.3|Why haven't my family paid my ransom? You may hold me as prisoner, but it seems that you care for me more than they do!
dlga_lady_stranded_next:close_window|Greetings, {s0}. The tides of war have left me stranded here in this fortress, but I will shortly be departing. 
dlga_start:lady_talk_refugee|{playername} -- I assume that you, as a {reg33?lady:man} of honor, will accord gentle-born {reg65?ladies:lads} such as ourselves the right to return to our families, and not demand a ransom.
dlga_start:lady_escort_lady_succeeded|Thank you for escorting me here, {playername}. Please accept this gift as a token of my gratitude. I hope we shall meet again sometime in the future.
dlga_lady_escort_lady_succeeded:close_window|It was an honor to serve you, {s65}.
dlga_start:close_window.67|We will shortly depart{s5}. It is good to know that some people in this world retain a sense of honor.
dlga_lady_talk_refugee:close_window|Of course, my lady
dlga_lady_talk_refugee:lady_captive_talk|You assume wrong, {reg65?my lady:sirrah}!
dlga_lady_captive_talk:lady_captive_confirm|What?! What infamy is this?
dlga_lady_captive_confirm:close_window|My apologies - you must have misunderstood me. Of course you may leave.
dlga_lady_captive_confirm:close_window.1|Contact your family to arrange for a ransom, my lady.
dlga_kingdom_lady_captive:close_window|Then write to your family, and ask them to hurry up with the ransom!
dlga_kingdom_lady_captive:close_window.1|I have changed my mind -- you are free to go
dlga_start:close_window.68|Well, {playername} -- you fought a duel with {s10}, and lost. According to our custom and tradition, I should no longer receive you. Farewell, {playername}.
dlga_start:lady_duel_lost|Oh {playername} -- I heard of your duel with {s10}. I wish now that you had never fought {reg3?her:him}, for our honor and tradition demand that, having lost to {reg3?her:him}, you now break off your suit with me. Farewell, {playername}.
dlga_lady_duel_lost:close_window|Very well - we must do as tradition demands... Farewell, my lady
dlga_lady_duel_lost:lady_duel_lost_flaunt_conventions|Let honor and tradition hang!
dlga_lady_duel_lost_flaunt_conventions:close_window|Oh, {playername}! Although people will talk, it would so break my heart to no longer be able to see you. We shall ignore this silly, cruel tradition.
dlga_lady_duel_lost_flaunt_conventions:close_window.1|No, {playername} -- I cannot afford to fritter away my good name, and neither can you.
dlga_start:lady_start|Oh, {playername} -- I have heard that you won your duel with {s10}. I'm grateful that you have delivered me from that {reg3?woman:man}'s attentions!
dlga_start:lady_start.1|Well, {playername} --  you won your duel with {s10}. Clearly, {reg3?she:he} was not worthy of my affections.
dlga_lady_duel_rep_1:lady_start|Well, {playername} --  you won your duel with {s10}. Oh, such foolishness, that {reg33?people:men} should fight over me! Sigh... But it is a bit romantic, I suppose.
dlga_lady_duel_rep_2:lady_start|Well, {playername} --  you won your duel with {s10}. Honor now demands that {reg0?she:he} and I no longer meet... I was fond of {reg0?her:him}, you know. You did me no service by fighting {reg0?her:him}, {sir/madame}.
dlga_start:lady_qst_duel_for_lady_succeeded_1|My dear {playername}, how joyous to see you again! I heard you gave that vile {s13} a well-deserved lesson. I hope {reg3?she:he} never forgets {reg3?her:his} humiliation. I've a reward for you, but I fear it's little compared to what you've done for me.
dlga_lady_qst_duel_for_lady_succeeded_1:lady_qst_duel_for_lady_succeeded_2|Oh, it will just have to do.
dlga_lady_qst_duel_for_lady_succeeded_1:lady_qst_duel_for_lady_succeeded_2.1|{s66}, this is far too much!
dlga_lady_qst_duel_for_lady_succeeded_1:lady_qst_duel_for_lady_succeeded_2.2|Please, {s65}, no reward is necessary.
dlga_lady_qst_duel_for_lady_succeeded_2:lady_pretalk|{s10}
dlga_start:lady_qst_deliver_letter_succeeded|My dear {playername}, how lovely to see you again! Did you manage to give my letter to {s13}? I hope he reacted favourably?
dlga_start:lady_qst_deliver_letter_failed|My dear {playername}, how lovely to see you again! Did you manage to give my letter to {s13}? I hope he reacted favourably?
dlga_lady_qst_deliver_letter_succeeded:lady_qst_deliver_letter_succeeded_2|Indeed, he likened you to a rainbow, I believe.
dlga_lady_qst_deliver_letter_succeeded:lady_qst_deliver_letter_failed_3|I'm afraid not. I think he loves another.
dlga_lady_qst_deliver_letter_failed:lady_qst_deliver_letter_succeeded_3|Indeed, his heart was filled with joy.
dlga_lady_qst_deliver_letter_failed:lady_qst_deliver_letter_failed_3|I'm afraid not. He was quite vocal on that point.
dlga_lady_qst_deliver_letter_succeeded_2:lady_pretalk|Oh, I am so happy! I feel like I could float right out the window! Thank you, {playername}. Thank you! Please accept this reward.
dlga_lady_qst_deliver_letter_succeeded_3:lady_pretalk|Why do you look at the floor when you say that? Look at me! I do not believe you! You come here and lie to me in my own home. Are you trying to make me look more foolish than I already am? Leave me now, you swine. I have lots of time to ponder my actions, and your presence does not help me.
dlga_lady_qst_deliver_letter_failed_3:lady_pretalk|No! My heart is broken in two. But you tried, {playername}, you tried. It was foolish of me to state my feelings. I shall know better next time. 
dlga_start:lady_qst_duel_for_lady_failed|I was told that you sought satisfaction from {s13} to prove my innocence, {playername}. It was a fine gesture, and I thank you for your efforts.
dlga_lady_qst_duel_for_lady_failed:lady_qst_duel_for_lady_failed_2|I beg your forgiveness for my defeat, {s65}...
dlga_lady_qst_duel_for_lady_failed_2:lady_pretalk|It matters not, dear {playername}. You tried. The truth cannot be proven at the point of a sword, but you willingly put your life at stake for my honour. That alone will convince many of my innocence.
dlga_start:lady_start.2|Ah {playername} - you must have received my message. How happy I am that you could come!
dlga_start:lady_proposal_pending|{playername} - is there any word from my family?
dlga_start:lady_betrothed|I hear that my {s11} has refused your request to marry me. Does that mean that we must part?
dlga_start:lady_generic_mission_succeeded|Oh, {playername}, you brought {reg4?her:him} back to me! Thank you ever so much for rescuing my {s11}. Please, take this as some small repayment for your noble deed.
dlga_start:rescue_prisoner_succeed_1|Oh, {playername}, you brought {reg4?her:him} back to me! Thank you ever so much for rescuing my {s11}. Please, take this as some small repayment for your noble deed.
dlga_rescue_prisoner_succeed_1:lady_pretalk|Always an honour to serve, {s65}.
dlga_start:lady_meet_end|You must be {playername}. We have just had the honor of watching you distinguish yourself in the recent tournament{s8}.
dlga_start:lady_meet_end.1|You must be {playername}. My {s15} {s16} has spoken most highly of you. I am delighted to make your acquaintance.
dlga_start:lady_premeet|I say, you don't look familiar...
dlga_start:close_window.69|Ah, {playername}. How good it is to see you again. However, I believe that I am required elsewhere.
dlga_start:lady_start.3|{playername} -- how good it is to see you. (Whispers:) I still remember your visits fondly.
dlga_start:lady_meet_end.2|Ah, {playername}. How spendid it was to see you distinguish yourself in the recent tournament.
dlga_start:lady_start.4|{s12}
dlga_lady_start:lady_betrothed2|I have sad news. I have become betrothed to {s5} -- against my will, I should say! Oh {playername} - I would so much rather be wed to you!
dlga_lady_start:lady_betrothed2.1|Good {playername} -- I have become betrothed to {s5}. It is now no longer seemly for us to see each other like this.
dlga_lady_start:lady_other_suitor|I must tell you -- there is another lord who has been paying me attentions, although I cannot abide {reg0?her:him}. I fear {reg0?she:he} has designs on me, and may try to force me to wed against my will.
dlga_lady_start:lady_talk|{s11}It is probably not suitable for us to tarry too long here in conversation, but I would hope to see you again soon.
dlga_lady_start:lady_talk.1|{s11}
dlga_lady_start:lady_talk.2|I was planning to retire for a little while, but perhaps we may have a chance to speak more later...
dlga_lady_start:lady_talk.3|It is so delightful to have a chance to spend some time together.{s12}
dlga_lady_start:lady_talk.4|What brings you here today?
dlga_lady_proposal_pending:close_window|No word so far...
dlga_lady_betrothed:lady_pretalk|CHEAT:  Wed me.
dlga_lady_proposal_pending:lady_proposal_pending_end|On second thought, now is not the time for us to marry
dlga_lady_proposal_pending_end:close_window|{s11}
dlga_lady_betrothed:lady_pretalk.1|Let us marry at once!
dlga_lady_betrothed2:lady_suggest_elope|Never! We must elope together at once!
dlga_lady_betrothed2:lady_pretalk|Perhaps I may still be able to change your {s11}'s mind
dlga_lady_betrothed2:lady_conclude_relationship|So be it -- let us then part
dlga_lady_betrothed2:lady_pretalk.1|CHEAT:  Wed me.
dlga_lady_suggest_elope:lady_conclude_relationship|Good {playername} -- you are a good and kind man, but a lady cannot defy her family. Such things are not done!
dlga_lady_suggest_elope:lady_other_suitor|{reg33?Madame:Sir} -- as you may know, I have been entertaining offers from a number of {reg33?suitors:gentlemen} such as yourself. I am not yet at a stage where I can commit to any of them.
dlga_lady_suggest_elope:lady_conclude_relationship.1|Ah {playername}, you must realize. You are still finding your way in the world. I have great affection for you, {playername}, but I will not consign myself to obscurity.
dlga_lady_suggest_elope:lady_conclude_relationship.2|Ah {playername}, although you are kind to me, I am not certain enough of your moral fiber to risk such a thing. Although I bear little affection for my betrothed, it would be a weighty thing to go against my family's wishes, and I am not certain enough of you to take that step.
dlga_lady_suggest_elope:lady_conclude_relationship.3|Good {playername} -- to elope would be to throw away my ties with my family, which are everything to me! I have a considerable affection for you, but I am not sure that I am prepared to risk that.
dlga_lady_suggest_elope:lady_conclude_relationship.4|Good {playername} -- I am not used to the hardships of campaigning as you are. I want a home to call my own. If you were lord of a castle or town with a great hall, I would gladly go there as your {reg0?wife:husband}, to be {reg0?mistress:keeper} of the household. But I do not wish to live like a hunted animal.
dlga_lady_suggest_elope:lady_elope_agree|Elope with you? Yes -- we could do that. It is a great step to defy my family -- but a loveless marriage, and life without you, might be a far worse thing! But be warned -- this will be a terrible blow to my {s11}'s prestige, and {reg4?she:he} will do everything in {reg4?her:his} power to bring you down.
dlga_lady_elope_agree:lady_elope_agree_nurse|Quickly, then! There is no time to lose.
dlga_lady_elope_agree:close_window|Everything in {reg4?her:his} power, you say? Em... Let me think about this...
dlga_lady_elope_agree_nurse:lady_elope_agree_lady_vows|Your lordship... Your ladyship... Would you like me to witness your exchange of vows?
dlga_lady_elope_agree_lady_vows:lady_elope_agree_nurse_2|Yes, do that. For my part, I make the following vow: I, {s4}, do swear that I accept {playername} as my {reg33?wife:husband}, according to the ancient law and custom of our land...
dlga_lady_elope_agree_nurse_2:lady_elope_agree_player_vows|Very good. Do you, {playername}, swear similarly to accept {s4} as your {reg65?wife:husband}?
dlga_lady_elope_agree_player_vows:close_window|I do.
dlga_lady_elope_agree_player_vows:close_window.1|Eh, what? This is all moving too fast...
dlga_lady_elope_agree:lady_conclude_relationship|Oh, really? My dear -- I could never separate a {reg65?lady:young lad} from {reg65?her:his} family like that...
dlga_lady_conclude_relationship:lady_conclude_relationship_confirm|So I suppose our time together must come to an end...
dlga_lady_conclude_relationship_confirm:lady_conclude_relationship_confirm_yes|Yes -- it must be...
dlga_lady_conclude_relationship_confirm:lady_conclude_relationship_confirm_no|Wait -- perhaps there is still a chance for us!
dlga_lady_conclude_relationship_confirm_yes:close_window|Farewell, {playername}. We will see each other, in the courts and castles of this realm, but we must keep our distance from each other. I will remember these days fondly, nonetheless.
dlga_lady_conclude_relationship_confirm_no:close_window|In that case, we shall see what the future brings.
dlga_lady_generic_mission_succeeded:lady_pretalk|Always an honour to serve, {s65}.
dlga_lady_premeet:lady_meet|I am {playername}.
dlga_lady_premeet:lady_meet.1|My name is {playername}. At your service.
dlga_lady_meet:lady_meet_end|Of course. How splendid to finally make your acquaintance.
dlga_lady_meet:lady_meet_end.1|{playername}? I do not believe I've heard of you before.
dlga_lady_meet_end:lady_talk|I am about to retire for a little while, but perhaps we may have a chance to speak more later...
dlga_lady_meet_end:lady_talk.1|Now, if you will excuse me...
dlga_lady_meet_end:lady_talk.2|Can I help you with anything?
dlga_lady_talk:lord_talk_ask_location|I want to know the location of someone.
dlga_lady_pretalk:lady_talk|Now, if you will excuse me...
dlga_lady_pretalk:lady_talk.1|Is there anything else?
dlga_lady_talk:dplmc_lady_relations2|I wished to ask about one of your relatives.
dlga_dplmc_lady_relations2:dplmc_lady_info_relative_select|About which lord do you want information?
dlga_dplmc_lady_info_relative_select:dplmc_lady_info_relative_1|Your {s11} {s18}
dlga_dplmc_lady_info_relative_select:lady_pretalk|Never mind.
dlga_dplmc_lady_info_relative_1:lady_pretalk|Pardon, but I do not feel comfortable discussing such personal matters with you.
dlga_dplmc_lady_info_relative_1:dplmc_lady_info_relative_2|{s47}
dlga_dplmc_lady_info_relative_1:lady_pretalk.1|{12}
dlga_dplmc_lady_info_relative_2:lady_pretalk|{s12}.
dlga_dplmc_lady_info_relative_2:lady_pretalk.1|{s1}
dlga_lady_talk:dplmc_lady_feasts|Do you know of any ongoing feasts?
dlga_dplmc_lady_feasts:lady_pretalk|{s12}
dlga_lady_talk:lady_relations|May I have the honor of knowing more about you, {reg65?my lady:good sir}?
dlga_lady_relations:lady_pretalk|{s12}
dlga_lady_talk:lady_profess_admiration|My {reg65?lady:lord}, I would like to profess myself your most ardent admirer
dlga_lady_talk:lady_tournament_dedication_reaction|My {reg65?lady:lord}, I would like to dedicate my successes in this recent tournament to you
dlga_lady_tournament_dedication_reaction:lady_pretalk|{s9}
dlga_lady_profess_admiration:close_window|{s11}I would like it very much if we could see more of each other.
dlga_lady_profess_admiration:lady_pretalk|Ah... You are too kind... My, the hour is getting rather late, isn't it? I really must be going.
dlga_lady_talk:lady_recite_poetry|Do you like poetry, my {reg65?lady:lord}?
dlga_lady_recite_poetry:lady_recite_poetry|That would depend on the poem. Did you intend to recite a verse?
dlga_lady_recite_poetry:lady_recite_poetry_response|The wind that blows the dry steppe dust...
dlga_lady_recite_poetry:lady_recite_poetry_response.1|All the silks of Veluca/All the furs of Khudan...
dlga_lady_recite_poetry:lady_recite_poetry_response.2|You are the first and the last/the outer and the inner...
dlga_lady_recite_poetry:lady_recite_poetry_response.3|A light pierced the gloom over Wercheg cliffs...
dlga_lady_recite_poetry:lady_recite_poetry_response.4|I deflected her skeptical questioning darts/with armor made of purest devotion...
dlga_lady_recite_poetry:lady_pretalk|Actually, I can't think of any that I would care to recite...
dlga_lady_recite_poetry_response:lady_private_conversation_end|{s11}
dlga_lady_private_conversation_end:lady_pretalk|Time is passing quickly, and we cannot linger here too long.
dlga_lady_talk:lady_marriage_discussion|Do you think that we may have a future together, {reg65?my lady:kind sir}?
dlga_lady_marriage_discussion:lady_other_suitor|{reg33?Madame:Sir} -- as you may know, I have been entertaining offers from a number of {reg33?ladies:gentlemen} such as yourself. I am not yet at a stage where I can commit to any of them.
dlga_lady_marriage_discussion:lady_proposal_refused|It is good to hear that you are thinking seriously about the future. However, I would like to see you rise a little further in the world before I am ready to commit to marry you.
dlga_lady_marriage_discussion:lady_proposal_refused.1|It is good to hear that your intentions are honorable. However, I have resolved only to marry a man of the strongest moral fiber. I would like you to prove yourself more in that regard.
dlga_lady_marriage_discussion:lady_proposal_refused.2|Sir -- it is comforting to hear that your intentions towards me are honorable. But perhaps we should take the time to get to allow our affections for each other to grow a little stronger, before making any such decision.
dlga_lady_marriage_discussion:lady_betrothed|Oh {playername}, how happy you have made me!
dlga_lady_marriage_discussion:lady_betrothed.1|Oh {playername}, how happy that would make me! But my {s11} {s4} would never allow it... Perhaps it is best that we part...
dlga_lady_marriage_discussion:close_window|Oh {playername}, how happy that would make me! Go ask my {s11} {s4} for permission!
dlga_lady_proposal_refused:lady_proposal_refused_persuade_check|Perhaps I can persuade you to delay no further.
dlga_lady_proposal_refused_persuade_check:lady_proposal_refused_persuade_player_response|What do you have to say?
dlga_lady_proposal_refused_persuade_player_response:lady_proposal_refused_persuade_result|Love is as a rose, my {reg65?lady:lord}. Left unplucked, it may wither.
dlga_lady_proposal_refused_persuade_player_response:lady_pretalk|Oh, never mind.
dlga_lady_proposal_refused_persuade_result:close_window|Enough, {reg33?madame:sir}! I shall not be rushed into marriage, with you or with anyone else! You have made me very cross. Please, leave me alone for a while. I shall let you know when I am ready to speak to you again.
dlga_lady_proposal_refused_persuade_result:lady_betrothed|Oh {playername}, I could never allow that to happen! Oh, if only we could be wed! But my {s11} {s4} would never give {reg4?her:his} permission... Perhaps it is best that we part...
dlga_lady_proposal_refused_persuade_result:close_window.1|Oh {playername}, I could never allow that to happen! Go ask my {s11} {s4} {reg4?her:his} permission for us to be wed!
dlga_lady_proposal_refused:close_window|Very well -- I shall continue to strive to be worthy of your esteem!
dlga_lady_proposal_refused:lady_player_threatens_compel|I am tired of these games! I will speak to your family about arranging a wedding immediately..
dlga_lady_player_threatens_compel:lady_player_threatens_compel_2|What? Do you mean that?
dlga_lady_player_threatens_compel_2:lady_private_conversation_end|No, of couse not. Please forgive my burst of temper
dlga_lady_player_threatens_compel_2:close_window|Yes -- you clearly do not know what is in your best interests.
dlga_lady_other_suitor:lady_pretalk|It grieves me to hear that, my {reg4?lady:lord}, but such things must be
dlga_lady_other_suitor:lady_other_suitor_challenge|Who is the miscreant! Tell me his name!
dlga_lady_other_suitor:lady_player_threatens_compel|I am tired of these games! I will demand that your family compel you to marry me..
dlga_lady_other_suitor_challenge:lady_pretalk|I would be so grateful! But from what I understand, you already have a duel on your hands. {reg0?She:He} is not honor-bound to fight you, if you are committed to another combat. Please, conclude your other business in a hurry, to rescue me from that {reg0?woman:man}'s attentions!.
dlga_lady_other_suitor_challenge:lady_pretalk.1|Ah! Such talk. But from what I hear, you already have a duel on your hands. Finish one before you start another! Sigh... {reg0?You {reg33?women:men}:People} can be so silly...
dlga_lady_other_suitor_challenge:lady_other_suitor_challenge_confirm|It is {s5}. Please, rescue me from that {reg0?woman:man}'s attentions!
dlga_lady_other_suitor_challenge:lady_other_suitor_challenge_confirm.1|Will you now? This should be interesting. Very well. Your rival is {s5}. Let us see which of you has the greater mettle.
dlga_lady_other_suitor_challenge:lady_other_suitor_challenge_confirm.2|Oh, fie! I wish that this were not a matter of honor, so I could refuse such a request. But alas, I feel compelled to tell you that your rival is {s5}. I wish that heaven had not granted me such a fair visage, so that I would not inspire such passions in {reg33?women:men}!
dlga_lady_other_suitor_challenge:lady_other_suitor_challenge_confirm.3|I will have none of such talk! It is nonsense for you and {s5} to fight over -- whoops! I beg of you, {reg33?madame:sir}, forget the name that just escaped my lips...
dlga_lady_other_suitor_challenge_confirm:lady_other_suitor_challenge_confirm_yes|So be it! I shall challenge {reg0?her:him} to a trial of arms!
dlga_lady_other_suitor_challenge_confirm:lady_other_suitor_challenge_confirm_no|On second thought, I let my passions run away with me there. Never mind.
dlga_lady_other_suitor_challenge_confirm_yes:lady_pretalk|{s15}
dlga_lady_other_suitor_challenge_confirm_no:lady_private_conversation_end|Good. You are wise not to let your temper guide you.
dlga_lady_talk:lady_ask_for_quest|Is there anything I can do to win your favour?
dlga_lady_ask_for_quest:lady_pretalk|I don't have anything else for you to do right now.
dlga_lady_ask_for_quest:lady_mission_told|Oh, I fear I may never see my {s17}, {s13}, again... {reg0?She:He} is a prisoner in the dungeon of {s14}. We have tried to negotiate {reg0?her:his} ransom, but it has been set too high. We can never hope to raise that much money without selling everything we own, and God knows {s13} would rather spend {reg0?her:his} life in prison than make us destitute. Instead I came up with a plan to get {reg0?her:him} out of there, but it requires someone to make a great sacrifice, and so far my pleas have fallen on deaf ears...
dlga_lady_ask_for_quest:lady_mission_told.1|My poor {s11}, {s13}, is a prisoner in the {s14} dungeons. The only way we can talk to each other is by exchanging letters whenever we can, but the journey is so dangerous that we get little chance to do so. Please, would you deliver one for me?
dlga_lady_ask_for_quest:lady_quest_duel_for_lady|Dear {playername}, you are kind to ask, but you know little of my troubles and I can't possibly ask you to throw yourself into danger on my behalf.
dlga_lady_quest_duel_for_lady:lady_quest_duel_for_lady_2|Tell me what the problem is, and I can make my own decision.
dlga_lady_quest_duel_for_lady_2:lady_quest_duel_for_lady_3|Very well, as you wish it... My {reg1?wife:husband} has made certain enemies in {reg1?her:his} life, {playername}. One of the most insidious is {s13}. {reg0?She:He} is going around making terrible accusations against me, impugning my honour at every turn! Because {reg0?she:he} cannot harm my {reg1?wife:husband} directly, {reg0?she:he} is using me as a target to try and stain our name. You should hear the awful things {reg0?she:he}'s said! I only wish there was someone brave enough to make {reg0?her:him} recant {reg0?her:his} slander, but {s13} is a very fine swordsman, and {reg0?she:he}'s widely feared...
dlga_lady_quest_duel_for_lady_3:lady_quest_duel_for_lady_3_accepted|I fear {reg0?her:him} not, {s65}. I will make {reg0?her:him} take back {reg0?her:his} lies.
dlga_lady_quest_duel_for_lady_3_accepted:close_window|Oh! I can't ask that of you, {playername}, but... I would be forever indebted to you, and you are so sure. It would mean so much if you would defend my honour. Thank you a thousand times, all my prayers and my favour go with you.
dlga_lady_quest_duel_for_lady_3:lady_quest_duel_for_lady_3_rejected|If {reg0?she:he}'s that dangerous, perhaps maybe it would be better to ignore {reg0?her:him}...
dlga_lady_quest_duel_for_lady_3_rejected:close_window|Oh... Perhaps you're right, {playername}. I should let go of these silly childhood ideas of chivalry and courage. {reg33?People:Men} are not like that, not anymore. Good day to you.
dlga_lady_ask_for_quest:lady_mission_deliver_letter|I need to send a letter to {s13} who should be currently at {s4}. If you will be heading towards there, would you deliver it to him? The letter needs to be in his hands in 30 days.
dlga_lady_mission_deliver_letter:lady_mission_deliver_letter_accepted|Certainly, I intend to pass by {s4} and it would be no trouble.
dlga_lady_mission_deliver_letter:lady_mission_deliver_letter_rejected|I doubt I'll be seeing {s13} anytime soon, {s65}. You'd best send it with someone else.
dlga_lady_mission_deliver_letter_accepted:close_window|I appreciate it, {playername}. Here's the letter, and a small sum to cover your travel expenses. Oh, one small thing. The contents of this letter, are rather confidential, so don't share them with anyone along the way. Oh, who am I kidding? In truth, this is a love letter, {playername}. I have been stricken with a deep love for {s13} and I do not know how this letter, into which I have poured my heart and soul, will be received. I can only hope that he will respond in kind. Go now.
dlga_lady_mission_deliver_letter_rejected:lord_pretalk|Ah, all right then. Well, I am sure I will find someone else.
dlga_lady_ask_for_quest:lady_pretalk.1|No, {playername}, I've no need for a champion right now.
dlga_lady_mission_told:lady_mission_accepted|As you wish it, {s65}, it shall be done.
dlga_lady_mission_told:lady_mission_rejected|{s66}, I fear I cannot help you right now.
dlga_lady_mission_accepted:close_window|You are a true {reg33?lady:gentleman}, {playername}. Thank you so much for helping me
dlga_lady_mission_rejected:close_window|You'll not help a {reg65?woman:young lad} in need? You should be ashamed, {playername}... Please leave me, I have some important embroidery to catch up.
dlga_lady_talk:lady_restore_relation|I want to improve my relation with a lord. Can you help me?
dlga_lady_restore_relation:lady_pretalk|{playername}, I don't know you well enough to act on your behalf. I am sorry.
dlga_lady_restore_relation:lady_restore_relation_2|Hmm. I guess you got on the wrong side of somebody. Very well, who do you want to restore your relation with?
dlga_lady_restore_relation_2:lady_restore_relation_2b|{s1}
dlga_lady_restore_relation_2:lady_pretalk|Never mind. I get along with everyone well enough.
dlga_lady_restore_relation_2b:lady_restore_relation_3|Well I can try to help you there. I am sure a few expensive gifts will make {s10} look at you more favorably.
dlga_lady_restore_relation_3:lady_restore_relation_4|You can improve your relation with {s10} by sending {reg4?her:him} a gift worth {reg10} aurums. But if you can afford spending {reg11} aurums on the gift, it would make a good impression on {reg4?her:him}. And if you can go up to {reg12} aurums, that would really help smooth things out.
dlga_lady_restore_relation_4:lady_restore_relation_5|I think a gift of {reg10} aurums will do.
dlga_lady_restore_relation_4:lady_restore_relation_5.1|Maybe I can afford {reg11} aurums.
dlga_lady_restore_relation_4:lady_restore_relation_5.2|In that case, I am ready to spend {reg12} aurums.
dlga_lady_restore_relation_4:lady_restore_relation_cant_afford|I don't think I can afford a gift at the moment.
dlga_lady_restore_relation_5:lady_restore_relation_6|Excellent. Then I'll choose an appropriate gift for you and send it to {s10} with your compliments. I am sure {reg4?she:he} will appreciate the gesture.
dlga_lady_restore_relation_6:lady_pretalk|Thank you for your help, madame.
dlga_lady_restore_relation_cant_afford:lady_pretalk|I am afraid, I can't be of much help in that case, {playername}. I am sorry.
dlga_lady_talk:lady_leave|I must beg my leave.
dlga_lady_leave:close_window|{s12}
dlga_convince_begin:convince_options|I still don't see why I should accept what you're asking of me.
dlga_convince_options:convince_bribe|Then I'll make it worth your while. ({reg8} aurums)
dlga_convince_options:convince_friendship|Please, do it for the sake of our friendship. (-{reg9} to relation)
dlga_convince_options:convince_persuade_begin|Let me try and convince you. (Persuasion)
dlga_convince_options:lord_pretalk|Never mind.
dlga_convince_bribe:convince_bribe_verify|Mmm, a generous gift to my coffers would certainly help matters... {reg8} aurums should do it. If you agree, then I'll go with your suggestion.
dlga_convince_bribe_verify:convince_bribe_cant_afford|I'm afraid my finances will not allow for such a gift.
dlga_convince_bribe_verify:convince_bribe_goon|Very well, please accept these {reg8} aurums as a token of my gratitude.
dlga_convince_bribe_verify:convince_begin|Let me think about this some more.
dlga_convince_bribe_cant_afford:convince_options|Ah. In that case, there is little I can do, unless you have some further argument to make.
dlga_convince_bribe_goon:convince_accept|My dear {playername}, your generous gift has led me to reconsider what you ask, and I have come to appreciate the wisdom of your proposal.
dlga_convince_friendship:convince_friendship_verify|You've done well by me in the past, {playername}, and for that I will go along with your request, but know that I do not like you using our relationship this way.
dlga_convince_friendship_verify:convince_friendship_go_on|I am sorry, my friend, but I need your help in this.
dlga_convince_friendship_verify:lord_pretalk|If it will not please you, then I'll try something else.
dlga_convince_friendship_go_on:convince_accept|All right then, {playername}, I will accept this for your sake. But remember, you owe me for this.
dlga_convince_friendship:lord_pretalk|I don't think I owe you such a favor {playername}. I see no reason to accept this for you.
dlga_convince_friendship:lord_pretalk.1|Is this a joke? You've some nerve asking me for favours, {playername}, and let me assure you you'll get none.
dlga_convince_persuade_begin:convince_persuade_begin_2|Very well. Make your case.
dlga_convince_persuade_begin_2:convince_persuade|[Attempt to persuade]
dlga_convince_persuade_begin_2:convince_begin|Wait, perhaps there is another way to convince you.
dlga_convince_persuade_begin:lord_pretalk|By God's grace, {playername}! Haven't we talked enough already? I am tired of listening to you, and I do not want to hear any more of it right now.
dlga_convince_persuade:convince_accept|All right, all right. You have persuaded me to it. I'll go ahead with what you suggest.
dlga_convince_persuade:convince_options|You've a point, {playername}, I'll admit that much. However I am not yet convinced I should do as you bid.
dlga_convince_persuade:convince_options.1|Enough, {playername}. You've a lot of arguments, but I find none of them truly convincing. I stand by what I said before.
dlga_convince_persuade:convince_options.2|Truthfully, {playername}, I fail to see the virtue of your reasoning. What you ask for makes even less sense now than it did before.
dlga_start:siege_won_seneschal_1|I must congratulate you on your victory, my {reg33?lady:lord}. Welcome to {s1}. We, the housekeepers of this castle, are at your service.
dlga_siege_won_seneschal_1:siege_won_seneschal_2|Are you the seneschal?
dlga_siege_won_seneschal_2:siege_won_seneschal_3|Indeed I am, my {reg33?lady:lord}. I have always served the masters of {s1} to the best of my ability, whichever side they might be on. Thus you may count on my utmost loyalty for as long as you are the {reg33?lady:lord} of this place. Now, do you intend to keep me on as the seneschal? I promise you will not be disappointed.
dlga_siege_won_seneschal_3:siege_won_seneschal_4|Very well, you may keep your post for the time being.
dlga_siege_won_seneschal_3:siege_won_seneschal_4.1|You can stay, but I shall be keeping a close watch on you.
dlga_siege_won_seneschal_4:siege_won_seneschal_5|Thank you, my {reg33?lady:lord}. If you do not mind my impudence, may I inquire as to what you wish to do with the castle?
dlga_siege_won_seneschal_5:siege_won_seneschal_6|I will sell it to another lord.
dlga_siege_won_seneschal_5:siege_won_seneschal_6.1|I intend to claim it for myself.
dlga_siege_won_seneschal_5:siege_won_seneschal_list_options|I haven't given it much thought. What are my options?
dlga_siege_won_seneschal_list_options:siege_won_seneschal_list_options_2|According to our laws and traditions, you can do one of several things. First, you could station a garrison here to protect the castle from any immediate counterattacks, then request an audience with some wealthy lord and ask him to make you an offer. It would be worth a tidy sum, believe you me. If you do not wish to sell, then you will have to find yourself a liege lord and protector who would accept homage from you. Without a royal investiture and an army at your back, you would have a difficult time holding on to the castle. Both you and {s1} would become great big targets for any man with a few soldiers and a scrap of ambition. 
dlga_siege_won_seneschal_list_options_2:siege_won_seneschal_list_options_3|What do you mean, a liege lord and protector? I won this place by my own hand, I don't need anyone else!
dlga_siege_won_seneschal_list_options_3:siege_won_seneschal_list_options_4|Of course you don't, my {reg33?lady:lord}. However, no lord in the land will recognize your claim to the castle unless it is verified by royal decree. They would call {s1} an outlaw stronghold and take it from you at the earliest opportunity. Surely not even you could stand against a whole army.
dlga_siege_won_seneschal_list_options_4:siege_won_seneschal_6|Hmm. I'll give it some thought.
dlga_siege_won_seneschal_6:close_window|I am very pleased to hear it, my {reg33?lady:lord}. I am only trying to serve you to the best of my ability. Now, if at any time you find you have further need of me, I will be in the great hall arranging a smooth handover of the castle to your forces. 
dlga_start:seneschal_intro_1|Good day, {reg33?madam:sir}. I do not believe I've seen you here before. Let me extend my welcome to you as the seneschal of {s1}.
dlga_seneschal_intro_1:seneschal_intro_1a|A pleasure to meet you, {s65}.
dlga_seneschal_intro_1a:seneschal_talk|How can I help you?
dlga_seneschal_intro_1:seneschal_intro_1b|What exactly do you do here?
dlga_seneschal_intro_1b:seneschal_talk|Ah, a seneschal's duties are many, good {reg33?woman:sire}. For example, I collect the rents from my lord's estates, I manage the castle's storerooms, I deal with the local peasantry, I take care of castle staff, I arrange supplies for the garrison... All mundane matters on this fief are my responsibility, on behalf of my lord. Everything except commanding the soldiers themselves.
dlga_start:seneschal_talk|Good day, {reg33?madam:sir}.
dlga_seneschal_pretalk:seneschal_talk|Anything else?
dlga_seneschal_talk:seneschal_ask_something|I would like to ask you a question...
dlga_seneschal_talk:seneschal_ask_about_someone|I wish to know more about someone...
dlga_seneschal_ask_about_someone:seneschal_ask_about_someone_2|Perhaps I may be able to help. Whom did you have in mind?
dlga_seneschal_ask_about_someone_2:seneschal_pretalk|Never mind.
dlga_seneschal_talk:close_window|I must take my leave of you now. Farewell.
dlga_seneschal_ask_something:seneschal_ask_something_2|I'll do what I can to help, of course. What did you wish to ask?
dlga_seneschal_ask_something_2:seneschal_ask_location|Perhaps you know where to find someone...
dlga_seneschal_ask_location:seneschal_ask_location_2|Well, a man in my position does hear a lot of things. Of whom were you thinking?
dlga_seneschal_ask_location_2:seneschal_ask_location_3|{s1}
dlga_seneschal_ask_location_2:seneschal_pretalk|Never mind.
dlga_seneschal_ask_location_3:seneschal_pretalk|{s1}
dlga_start:close_window.70|There! I can see the walls of {s3} in the distance. We've made it safely. Here, take this purse of {reg3} aurums, as I promised. I hope we can travel together again someday.
dlga_start:talk_caravan_escort|We've made it this far... Is everything clear up ahead?
dlga_talk_caravan_escort:talk_caravan_escort_2a|There might be bandits nearby. Stay close.
dlga_talk_caravan_escort_2a:close_window|Trust me, {playername}, we're already staying as close to you as we can. Lead the way.
dlga_talk_caravan_escort:talk_caravan_escort_2b|No sign of trouble, we can breathe easy.
dlga_talk_caravan_escort_2b:close_window|I'll breathe easy when we reach {s1} and not a moment sooner. Let's keep moving.
dlga_start:merchant_talk|What do you want? We paid our toll to you less than three days ago.
dlga_start:merchant_talk.1|Hail, friend.
dlga_start:merchant_talk.2|What do you want? We are but simple merchants, we've no quarrel with you, so leave us alone.
dlga_start:merchant_talk.3|Be warned, knave! This caravan is under the protection of {s9}. Step out of our way or you will face his fury!
dlga_start:merchant_talk.4|Yes? What do you want?
dlga_merchant_pretalk:merchant_talk|Anything else?
dlga_merchant_talk:caravan_start_war_quest_1|You are trespassing in the territory of the {s17}. I am confiscating this caravan and all its goods!
dlga_caravan_start_war_quest_1:caravan_start_war_quest_2|What? What nonsense is this? We are at peace with the {s17}, and are free to cross its lands!
dlga_caravan_start_war_quest_2:merchant_attack|We'll see about that! Defend yourselves!
dlga_caravan_start_war_quest_2:close_window|Hmm. Maybe this was all a misunderstanding. Farewell.
dlga_merchant_talk:merchant_talk_offer|I have an offer for you.
dlga_merchant_talk_offer:merchant_talk_offer_2|What is it?
dlga_merchant_talk_offer_2:caravan_offer_protection|I can escort you to your destination for a price.
dlga_merchant_talk_offer_2:merchant_pretalk|Nothing. Forget it
dlga_merchant_talk:merchant_bandit_information|I am hunting a group of bandits with the following description... Have you seen them?
dlga_merchant_bandit_information:merchant_pretalk|{s15}

dlga_merchant_talk:merchant_demand|I demand something from you!
dlga_merchant_demand:merchant_demand_2|What do you want?
dlga_merchant_demand_2:merchant_demand_toll|There is a toll for free passage here!
dlga_merchant_demand_toll:merchant_demand_toll_2|Please, I don't want any trouble. I can give you {reg6} aurums, just let us go.
dlga_merchant_demand_toll:merchant_demand_toll_2.1|I don't want any trouble. I can give you {reg6} aurums if you'll let us go.
dlga_merchant_demand_toll_2:merchant_demand_toll_accept|Agreed, hand it over and you may go in peace.
dlga_merchant_demand_toll_accept:close_window|Very well then. Here's {reg6} aurums. 
dlga_merchant_demand_toll_2:merchant_pretalk|I changed my mind, I can't take your money.
dlga_merchant_demand_toll_2:merchant_attack|No, I want everything you have! [Attack]
dlga_merchant_demand_2:merchant_attack_begin|Hand over your gold and valuables now!
dlga_merchant_demand_2:merchant_pretalk|Nothing. Forget it.
dlga_merchant_attack_begin:merchant_attack_verify|Are you robbing us?{s11}
dlga_merchant_attack_verify:merchant_attack_verify_norob|Robbing you? No, no! It was a joke.
dlga_merchant_attack_verify_norob:close_window|God, don't joke about that, {reg33?lass:lad}. For a moment I thought we were in real trouble.
dlga_merchant_attack_verify:merchant_attack|Of course I'm robbing you. Now hand over your goods.
dlga_merchant_attack:close_window|Damn you, you won't get anything from us without a fight!
dlga_caravan_offer_protection:caravan_offer_protection_2|These roads are dangerous indeed. One can never have enough protection.
dlga_caravan_offer_protection_2:close_window|An escort? We're almost there already! Thank you for the offer, though.
dlga_caravan_offer_protection_2:caravan_offer_protection_3|We are heading to {s1}. I will pay you {reg2} aurums if you escort us there.
dlga_caravan_offer_protection_3:caravan_offer_protection_4|Agreed.
dlga_caravan_offer_protection_4:caravan_offer_protection_5|I want you to stay close to us along the way. We'll need your help if we get ambushed by bandits.
dlga_caravan_offer_protection_5:caravan_offer_protection_6|Don't worry, you can trust me.
dlga_caravan_offer_protection_6:close_window|Good. Come and collect your money when we're within sight of {s1}. For now, let's just get underway.
dlga_caravan_offer_protection_3:caravan_offer_protection_4b|Forget it.
dlga_caravan_offer_protection_4b:close_window|Perhaps another time, then.
dlga_merchant_talk:talk_caravan_enemy_2|Not so fast. First, hand over all your goods and money.
dlga_talk_caravan_enemy_2:close_window|Never. It is our duty to protect these goods. You shall have to fight us, brigand!

dlga_dplmc_prison_guard_talk_prisoner_select:dplmc_prison_guard_exchange_prisoner_ask_confirm|{s10} of {s11}.

dlga_dplmc_prison_guard_exchange_prisoner_confirm:close_window|Very well.
dlga_dplmc_prison_guard_exchange_prisoner_confirm:close_window.1|No, I changed my mind.
dlga_prison_guard_ask_prisoners:prison_guard_talk|Currently, {s50} {reg1?are:is} imprisoned here.{s49}
dlga_prison_guard_visit_prison:close_window|Of course, {reg33?madam:sir}. Go in.
dlga_prison_guard_visit_prison:prison_guard_visit_prison_2|You need to get permission from the lord to talk to prisoners.
dlga_prison_guard_visit_prison:prison_guard_visit_prison_nobody|There is nobody inside, therefore you can freely go inside and look around.
dlga_prison_guard_visit_prison_nobody:close_window|All right then. I'll take a look at the prison.
dlga_prison_guard_visit_prison_nobody:close_window.1|I have more important business to do.
dlga_prison_guard_visit_prison_2:close_window|All right then. I'll try that.
dlga_prison_guard_visit_prison_2:prison_guard_visit_prison_3|Come on now. I thought you were the boss here.
dlga_prison_guard_visit_prison_3:prison_guard_visit_prison_4|He-heh. You got that right. Still, I can't let you into the prison.
dlga_prison_guard_visit_prison_4:close_window|All right then. I'll leave now.
dlga_prison_guard_visit_prison_4:prison_guard_visit_prison_5|I found a purse with 100 aurums a few paces away. I reckon it belongs to you.
dlga_prison_guard_visit_prison_5:close_window|Ah! I was looking for this all day. How good of you to bring it back {reg33?madam:sir}. Well, now that I know what an honest {reg33?lady:man} you are, there can be no harm in letting you inside for a look. Go in.... Just so you know, though -- I'll be hanging onto the keys, in case you were thinking about undoing anyone's chains.
dlga_prison_guard_visit_prison_4:prison_guard_visit_break|Give me the keys to the cells -- now!

dlga_castle_guard_intro_1:castle_guard_intro_2|I want to enter the hall and speak to the lord.
dlga_castle_guard_intro_1:close_window|Never mind.
dlga_castle_guard_intro_2:close_window|I'm afraid there is a feast in progress, and you are not invited.
dlga_castle_guard_intro_2:castle_guard_intro_3|You can go in after leaving your weapons with me. No one is allowed to carry arms into the lord's hall.
dlga_castle_guard_intro_3:close_window|Here, take my arms. I'll go in.
dlga_castle_guard_intro_3:castle_guard_intro_2b|No, I give my arms to no one.
dlga_castle_guard_intro_2b:close_window|Then you can't go in.
dlga_start:castle_gate_guard_talk|What do you want?
dlga_castle_gate_guard_pretalk:castle_gate_guard_talk|Yes?
dlga_castle_gate_guard_talk:castle_gate_open|We need shelter for the night. Will you let us in?

dlga_castle_gate_open:close_window.2|Come on in. I am opening the gates for you.
dlga_castle_gate_open:close_window.3|Come on in. But make sure your men behave sensibly within the walls. My lord {s2} does not want trouble here.

dlga_start:close_window.82|Thank you for your help, {reg33?madam:sir}. It was fortunate to have you nearby.
dlga_start:kidnapped_girl_liberated_battle|Oh {reg33?madam:sir}. Thank you so much for rescuing me. Will you take me to my family now?
dlga_start:freed_hero_answer|I am in your debt for freeing me friend.

dlga_freed_hero_answer_3:close_window.1|No, I want to go on my own.
dlga_start:vet1|Who are you, if I may ask?
dlga_vet1:vet2|Good sir, I am a Tolranian veteran. I am a direct descendant of Otto Waveshore, the man who led the first Tolranians onto Perisno. Do you our history?
dlga_vet2:vet_history|No. I would like to know more.
dlga_vet_history:vet_history_1|Of course. We, the Tolranians, were once a part of the Old Hakkon Empire from an island far from here. The Hakkon ruler was a tyrant, and a small group of men escaped using boats. It was a miracle they survived, and part of the reason was because of my ancestor, Otto Waveshore, who was a great captain.
dlga_vet_history_1:close_window|Very interesting. I guess I will leave now.
dlga_vet2:close_window|Yes, I am familiar with it. It was a nice talk.
dlga_start:veteran_introduce_2|Hello again. What is it this time?
dlga_veteran_introduce_2:veteran_met|Hello again. What is it this time?
dlga_veteran_met:veteran_met_history|I wwould like to know about your past, if you are willing to share.
dlga_veteran_met_history:close_window|I am a direct descendant of Otto Waveshore, the captain who led a small group of rebels from the Hakkon Island to Perisno, where we could live a new life.
dlga_veteran_met:close_window|Nevermind.
dlga_start:royal_scribe_introduction|Who are you?
dlga_royal_scribe_introduction:royal_scribe_introduction_1|Why, I am the royal scribe of Tolrania, of course. I chronicle the events and history of our great nation.
dlga_royal_scribe_introduction_1:close_window|That's nice. Goodbye.
dlga_royal_scribe_introduction_1:royal_scribe_tolrania_lore|Could you tell me more about the history of Tolrania?
dlga_royal_scribe_tolrania_lore:royal_scribe_tolrania_ask|Of course! What would you like to know about?
dlga_royal_scribe_tolrania_ask:royal_scribe_tolrania_ask_king|King Torlian.
dlga_royal_scribe_tolrania_ask_king:royal_scribe_tolrania_ask_king_1|King Torlian was the son of King Calarin, who was considered to be one our wisest and most benevolent monarchs of all time. When Calarin died at the age of seventy eight, he ascended upon the throne. He is not a bad ruler, but is always under pressure of his nobles telling him to live up to his father's name. 
dlga_royal_scribe_tolrania_ask_king_1:royal_scribe_tolrania_ask_king_2|Personally I think he has, in more ways than one. Take the Battle of Haelinfields, for example. King Torlian led the army himself against a superior Elintoran army. Torlian knew that they had many archers, so he lined all his Kingsmen with shields up and ordered them to lock shields the Volheere way. They advanced, under a hail of arrows. It is said that King Torlian himself was at the front.
dlga_royal_scribe_tolrania_ask_king_2:royal_scribe_tolrania_ask_king_3|While the foolish Elves wasted their arrows on our shields, the Horse Archers stealthily encircled the enemy army and soon the Elves were the ones being shot. Then, Torlian ordered his mounted Kingsmen Vanguard to advance and after a few hours of scattered fighting, the Elves were beaten. We slaughtered over six thousand elves that day, and lost only five hundred of our own. T'was a great victory!
dlga_royal_scribe_tolrania_ask_king_3:close_window|That was an interesting talk. Goodbye.
dlga_royal_scribe_tolrania_ask:close_window|Nevermind.
dlga_start:close_window.83|You are not a lord of Tolrania. Don't think that I will tell any of our secrets!
dlga_start:met_1|Hello again. What do you need from this humble scribe?
dlga_met_1:royal_scribe_tolrania_ask|I would like to know of some history of Tolrania.
dlga_met_1:close_window|Nothing. Sorry for disturbing you.
dlga_start:noble_introduction|Who are you?
dlga_noble_introduction:noble_lore|I am Lord Halgar Malin, a minor noble of Tolrania. I participated in the War of the Woods in the year 320. We fought against the Elintoran rats and routed them in a great battle. King Torlian himself led our army. I still bear the scars from that battle, and proudly too.
dlga_noble_lore:noble_lore_2|The Elintoran fools were so busy concentrating on our kingsmen that they did not notice as our horse archers surrounded and completely devastated their army. Of course, once the Kingsmen got into the melee, it was all over.
dlga_noble_lore_2:close_window|Very interesting! Goodbye.
dlga_start:noble_introduction.1|Who are you again?
dlga_start:scholar_introduction|Hello there, traveller.
dlga_scholar_introduction:scholar_lore|Hello.
dlga_scholar_lore:scholar_lore_2|Have you found the republic in your journey so far?
dlga_scholar_lore_2:scholar_lore_3|A what?
dlga_scholar_lore_3:scholar_lore_4|A republic. A system of government where the ruler is...ahh, never mind. Here I go again.
dlga_scholar_lore_4:scholar_lore_5|Tell me more.
dlga_scholar_lore_5:scholar_lore_6|I was hoping you'd tell me! I'm a foreigner to these lands, a historian from the Klyrintin Empire. One day I came across the news that some people had broken away from the empire and formed a 'republic' in this land. I consulted the scripts about this 'republic' and concluded that it was a fairer system of government for the people. I left my old life behind in search of this republic, but haven't found it so far. Have you seen it?
dlga_scholar_lore_6:close_window|I'll let you know if I hear anything.
dlga_scholar_lore_4:close_window|Goodbye crazy man.
dlga_scholar_lore_2:close_window|Uhh, I have to be somewhere else.
dlga_start:scholar_met|Hello. Have you found the republic yet? I am a foreigner, from the Klyrintin Empire, with a very oppresive government. I came here to search for the ideas of a republic after reading some scripts.
dlga_scholar_met:close_window|No... I need to be going. Goodbye.
dlga_tavern_traveler_talk:tavern_traveler_tell_remus_1|What's new?
dlga_tavern_traveler_tell_remus_1:tavern_traveler_tell_remus_2|Oh, you are that guy! Remus wanted me to tell you that during a recent tournament he heard rumors that a large group of Sut giants grew interested in the path of the Wolf, and they seek to join those Wolf Knights. Remus left for the town of Sut and he's looking for help.
dlga_tavern_traveler_tell_remus_2:close_window|I don't want no business with the Wolf Knights!
dlga_tavern_traveler_tell_remus_2:close_window.1|Alright, I'll find him then.
dlga_start:failed_remus_1|Hello, {playername}! It's good to see you.
dlga_failed_remus_1:meadbrewer_taskgiver_failed|I failed the quest.
dlga_start:victory_remus_1|Hello, {playername}! It's good to see you.
dlga_victory_remus_1:victory_remus_2|Group Sut Giant Interested in the Path of the Wolf is destroyed.
dlga_victory_remus_2:close_window|Good work.  That's your reward. But be careful. People over there are watching you. And I don't think their intentions are good.
dlga_start:remus_sut_1|Hello, {playername}! It's good to see you. I've learned that many giants here became interested in the path of the Wolf. One quite agressive group already went on their way to find the Wolf Knights. You need to stop them while I'm trying to calm down the giants that still stay in the town.
dlga_remus_sut_1:close_window|I don't want to mess with Wolf Knights or their followers.
dlga_remus_sut_1:close_window.1|Sure, I'll deal with them.
dlga_start:remus_intro| Greetings, traveler. Care for a drink?
dlga_remus_intro:remus_prelude|Sure. Thank you.
dlga_remus_prelude:remus_prelude_1|There you go. Don't worry about paying me or anything - it's on me. The innkeep here doesn't charge me anything after I helped them out with a gambling debt. Then again, they don't charge for things within reason of course... but still. They're generous souls. A far cry from the people I used to associate with.
dlga_remus_prelude_1:remus_prelude_2|What sort of people?
dlga_remus_prelude_2:story_ask|The Wolf Knights. My story with them is a long one, but I'm willing to share if you're willing to listen.
dlga_story_ask:wk_story1|Absolutely. Please tell me.
dlga_wk_story1:wk_story2|Where to begin... 
dlga_wk_story2:wk_story3|I am the younger of two brothers. We lived in a small village nestled amongst the foothills of the Reich's mountains. It was a fairly isolated place that saw the older men mindlessly driving away at their chores while the younger men nurtured dreams of the world that lay beyond the village. Lupus, my older brother, was in charge of guarding the village animals from the wolves that lived not far away. Every night he would stand vigil over our meager livestock, with the howling of the wolves to help keep him awake.
dlga_wk_story3:wk_story4|Strangely, the wolves never attacked. They would prowl in the darkness, barely visible by the light of Lupus' torch, but they never approached. My brother complained to our village elder, Garrell, that his position was useless. Elder Garrell wouldn't have any of that. 'Nonsense!' he would say, and Lupus would spend the next few nights without provisions.
dlga_wk_story4:wk_story5|Eventually, my brother came to me one day all worked up over something. He kept flexing his fingers, eyes wide and shoulders shaking. From fear, anxiety, or exhilaration, I couldn't tell. One of the wolves approached him the other night, he told me. Spoke to him in the human tongue. Asked him to follow it.
dlga_wk_story5:wk_story6|Sounds like he had just fallen asleep or something.
dlga_wk_story6:wk_story7| That's what I thought too. Yet he vehemently denied that suggestion, insisting that the wolf had spoken to him. 'Okay then,' I said. I asked him what the wolf had shown him. He wouldn't tell me. He just shook his head and ran off to the village well for water. Then the next day came. Lupus and another lad got into a heated argument that drew the whole village around. The argument threatened to get violent when Lupus's hands blurred faster than our eyes could follow... and smashed the man's head into bloody pieces.
dlga_wk_story7:wk_story8|That couldn't be good...
dlga_wk_story8:wk_story9| It certainly wasn't. We stood there in stunned silence, too afraid to say or do anything, while Lupus stared at his bloody hands. Elder Garrell was the first to gather his senses about him. He proclaimed Lupus exiled from the village the moment he did.
dlga_wk_story9:wk_story10|Why not just hang him?
dlga_wk_story10:wk_story11|I imagine it had something to do with my brother's apparent super strength - getting him in the gallows would've been a hard task, looking back on things. Despite what he did, I couldn't stand the thought of my brother travelling alone. I asked Elder Garrell if I could leave with Lupus. He nodded, but I think his mind was still trying to process what had happened. We left the village at dawn, with no farewells from the people we grew up with. As we trudged away, Lupus stopped me and laid his hand upon my forehead. 'Blessings upon you, brother,' he said. And what happened next...was... I don't know how to describe it.
dlga_wk_story11:wk_story12|Imagine the thrill of adrenaline, the bloodlust of battle. Now take that energy, and multiply it a hundred fold. That energy coursed through my    veins, leaving me paralyzed... But when I regained my senses, I felt reborn. I felt strong. Powerful. Able to take on the world, a million to one. It was strange. After his blessing, I could lift boulders with one hand, and run faster than deer... We began our lives anew. At first we traveled from city to city, fighting in the arenas. Our strength was unmatched - Lupus could shatter shields with a flick of his wrist. I would dart around my opponents and knock them to the ground before they knew what was happening.
dlga_wk_story12:wk_story13|Surely you are joking.
dlga_wk_story12:close_window|This is enough. At first I believed your tale, but now I think it is pure fantasy. Good day.
dlga_wk_story13:wk_story13_1|I do not jest. I could knock you to the ground and be out of the city before you could get back on your feet. But moving on... We won fight after fight, tournament after tournament. Prize money came to us, and we eventually bought our own armor, weapons, horses even. Notoriety came too, and soon we had a small following. Lupus had an idea. Why not go bigger, beyond the arena? Become mercenaries, he said, and see more of what the world has to offer. We recruited from our following of admiring fighters. And so the Wolf Knights were born.
dlga_wk_story13_1:wk_story14|I am afraid I have not the time for any more today. Perhaps another time.
dlga_wk_story14:close_window|Yes, I understand. Farewell, traveler. I shall finish my tale the next time we meet, if you will.
dlga_wk_story5:close_window|Impossible. I'm not going to listen to your story any longer, fool man. Goodbye and good day.
dlga_story_ask:close_window|Forgive me, but I don't have the time.
dlga_remus_intro:close_window|No thanks. I've got things to attent to.
dlga_start:remus2|Hello, traveler. We meet again.
dlga_remus2:wk_story15|Can you finish your story?
dlga_remus2:wk_story1|Can you repeat the first part of your story?
dlga_remus2:close_window|Goodbye. Maybe next time we shall meet again.
dlga_wk_story15:wk_story16|Roaming through the misty forests of the Elintoran Nation, traversing the dry deserts of Drahara, meeting Lords and Ladies for employment. It was amazing. And exhilirating. We won battle after battle, always fulfilling whatever tasks the lords of Perisno set upon us. More soldiers, experienced veterans, joined us. The feeling of fabulous wealth and glory... Ah, there are no words to describe it. Lupus even found an old abandoned fort. We used it as a base of operations, and with our newfound wealth we had turned it into a fortress to rival that of any lord's...
dlga_wk_story16:wk_story17|It all sounds too good...
dlga_wk_story17:wk_story18|Of course it was. Life does not ride upon a single wave of euphoria. My brother was changing. I didn't notice it, nor did my other brothers, as we ourselves were changing as well. We were getting more ruthless. Brutal. Merciless. Bloodlust became our one true companion in battle, blind rage consuming us as we tore down our enemies. Lupus was getting more ideas. 'These so called lords are weak,' he told us one night. 'They are foolish, ever quarrelsome, unfit to hold their titles! They cater to the feeble, leech off the strong!''My brothers, Perisno is ripe for the taking!' he yelled.
dlga_wk_story18:wk_story19|'Let me cast down the pretenders that lounge in their thrones,' said he. 'And let us show them the true meaning of power!' We all cheered him on, our adrenaline going into overdrive. The idea that we could hold our own kingdom, or even conquer all of Perisno? Anything seemed possible to us.
dlga_wk_story19:wk_story20|So, what happened?.
dlga_wk_story20:wk_story21|Well, nothing happened to the Wolf Knights per se. It's what happened to me.One night came when we raided a Tolranian caravan in the woods outside of Vinica. They never knew we were coming. We charged out of the darkness, our lances lowered, swords swinging, their blood splashing... There was a caravan guard. Couldn't have been any older than me or Lupus when we left our home. I killed his horse while he attempted to flee, sending him to the ground, leaving him trapped under the weight of his dead companion. 'Mercy,' he begged, with my sword at his throat. He was a grown man, fresh into adulthood... and bawling his eyes out like a small child, sobbing into the night.
dlga_wk_story21:wk_story22|I did nothing. In the midst of the clashing swords and dying screams, his face stood out above all else. I didn't know what was happening. The bloodlust was fading, and I was staring at the red and pink gore splashed across my greaves...Lupus came in bloodied armor on his black mare, saw what was happening, and plunged his sword into the guard's chest. He twisted the blade, and drew out the man's screams before he choked on his own blood. And my brother simply glared at me, and rode off. Later that night, he drew me away from the camp. I thought he wanted to reprimand me, scold me for my hesitation. 'I can't do this anymore,' I heard myself saying.
dlga_wk_story22:wk_story23|The most peculiar sensation overcame me, and suddenly I was on the ground, staring at a sword embedded in my gut. My own brother had stabbed me. 'You are weak,' I heard Lupus say. 'The pack cannot function with a lone wolf in its midst. Face death bravely, Remus.' And he left. The last I ever saw of him... his silhouette blocking out the stars above. The night was getting darker, the stars dimmer. I passed out from the wound, and might have died were it not for a passing elven lord. I owe Archduke Methenor my life. Had his party not come investigating what had happened, I would surely have died, isolated and alone. He recognized my face from seeing it in the arenas, and took me into his castle to heal me.
dlga_wk_story23:wk_story24|So, what did you do then?
dlga_wk_story24:wk_story25|It took months, but I was able to recover thanks to him. I inquired about the raiding party my brother and I had led, without inferring I helped organize it, and discovered that they had left before Methenor came. I felt different once I had become healed, more determined and less wild. I turned down Methenor's suggestion that I swear homage to Queen Arwen, thanked him by swearing a life debt to him, and left for the Reich. I eventually found the old village I grew up in... in burned ruins. Everyone dead and gone. Bandits, apparently. Perhaps it was Lupus. 
dlga_wk_story25:wk_story26| I tried finding the fortress we had set up for the Wolf Knights. I couldn't find it, because I couldn't remember where it was... It's strange. You'd think I would remember where it would be...Anyways, I now spend my days travelling the land, looking for hints of Lupus' whereabouts. Perisno needs to know the threat he poses. His world is one where only the strong will thrive, while the rest shall be cast down.
dlga_wk_story26:wk_story27|That was quite the tale... thank you for sharing it.
dlga_wk_story27:wkquest1|No, thank you for listening. I've never told my tale in its entirety before. Beware the wolves, friend. And remember... the wolf can survive without the pack.
dlga_wkquest1:wkquest2|I shall indeed beware them ...
dlga_wkquest2:wkquest3|Wait! I almost forgot! Could you visit Archduke Methenor sometime, and tell him: 'I, Remus, still search for it. I am sorry.'? Please accept this as a token of my gratitude for listening as well. Anyone who is forced to endure my dreary tale should at least get some type of reward.
dlga_wkquest1:close_window|Goodbye. I hope I will see you again sometime.
dlga_wkquest3:close_window|Of course. Thank you again for that story.
dlga_lord_talk:remustalk1|Remus told me to say that he is sorry and he still searches for it.
dlga_remustalk1:remustalk2|What? How do you know Remus? That lad is still alive?
dlga_remustalk2:remustalk3|Yes. I met him in a tavern and he told me to convene the message to you. He told me his entire story. It was saddening.
dlga_remustalk3:close_window|Indeed. That lad has had a miserable past. I hope he is well ... (the lord's eyes grow distant). Thank you for giving me this. Take this as a token of my gratitude. Farewell.
dlga_start:formerruler|Those bastards, HIC... They knew all about it HIC... Cowards, HIC.
dlga_formerruler:formerruler1|Listen my good man, I think you've had enough to drink today.
dlga_formerruler1:formerruler2|Just go away like everyone else HIC... Just leave me alone... HIC
dlga_formerruler2:formerruler3|Alright... Alright... Just give me that *you take his drink*. Now, let's talk. What's the story behind this drink?
dlga_formerruler3:formerruler4|(You spend some time with the man as he sobs quietly into his hands. He eventually becomes -somewhat- sober.)
dlga_formerruler4:formerruler5|You are still here? Well... alright. If it returns me to my drinking sooner, why not. Years ago, there was a great realm going from the mountains to the south, all the way to the Elintoran forest in the east. The name of this place was the Kingdom of Randor. The Kingdom's might was feared by everyone in Perisno. Even the elves showed us respect. But none of that mattered. When Randor was at it's strongest, the invaders came. They claimed to have fled from a far distant land. A land where disease, war and famine did rot the very essence of the land, the people.
dlga_formerruler5:formerruler6|They claimed they weren't like them, and only desired peace... but behind our backs, they plotted with the other kingdoms. Together, they formed an alliance against us. The King of Randor couldn't believe it. They had deceived him, they had taken his hospitality and tossed it to the ground like garbage. The alliance took the King by surprise and..
dlga_formerruler6:formerruler7|Wait wait wait. What does this have to do with your drinking problem?
dlga_formerruler7:formerruler8|If someone didn't interrupt me, I would have gotten to that point sooner... So as I was saying, the alliance took the King by surprise. Before he could even send out his orders, the alliance attacked. In no time at all, they had taken half of his country. Together, they formed a coalition army and marched on the capital of the Kindgom of Randor. The Great city of Beler, the last stronghold of Randor. The siege went on for months. By the time the coalition army entered the city, many of it's inhabitants had already died from hunger, or by their own hands fearing the horrors of being conquered.
dlga_formerruler8:formerruler9|The King and his family were left alone in the citadel protected by the last of the Royal guard. That is when the worst tragedy struck, one of the most cruel and vicious acts of the war. Lundrill, captain of the Royal guard, betrayed the King. He butchered the King's family, and gave their heads along with the captured King to the leaders of the coalition army. All of this, in exchange for the title and rights of the Lord of Beren.
dlga_formerruler9:formerruler10|What he didn't know was that the coalition leaders were already planning on betraying him. They did just that when they razed the city to the ground, and burned the citadel with the remnants of the Royal guard alive inside, killing off the last of the Randorians...
dlga_formerruler10:formerruler11|Are you sure you are sober? I've never heard of Randor or anyone you've mentioned... anyway, continue on. What does all of this have to do with you? 
dlga_formerruler11:formerruler12|Don't you get it, they wiped out an entire civilization! They are dangerous, they are liars, they are thieves! They betrayed me and left me to wander the world as punishment for thinking I could rule something they wanted to rule themselves.
dlga_formerruler12:formerruler13|Look sir, I'll ask you agai... OH wait, so you were the King of Randor?
dlga_formerruler13:formerruler14|The man looks sadly at the player, nodding his head up and down. Yes, I was... But that's a mistake I'll never make again.
dlga_formerruler14:close_window|Okay... I'll leave you to your drinking then.
dlga_formerruler14:formerrulerattack|Sounds like a load of grown up Falki dung.
dlga_formerrulerattack:close_window|Why you... you... you little runt! I am the King! I'll crush you!
dlga_start:close_window.84|(After your previous talk with the man, he does not want to look at you any longer. He stares sadly at his drink, thinking of the days of old, when he was the ruler of Randor.)
dlga_start:close_window.85|I told you!! DOOOOM! RUN!! THE ZANN ARE HERE! IN PERISNO!! They will conquer all, their armies will shake the earch and their Imperial Warriors, with armor as black as midnight, will conquer the world. DOOOM!
dlga_start:close_window.86|How... how could it be! The Zann have been defeated. Doomsday is over. We have survived!
dlga_start:ddmm1|DOOOM! We are ALL RUINED!!!!.
dlga_ddmm1:ddmm2|Do you feel alright good man?
dlga_ddmm2:ddmm3|They are coming... He is coming... They, he will rule over all of us. He, they will make us all slaves, light will be no more. They are coming... He is coming...
dlga_ddmm3:ddmm4|Who's they? Who's he? What are rambling on about?
dlga_ddmm4:ddmm5|They live over the infinite waves, across a continent so far and vast. They will come, he will lead them. Revenge, power, a new empire will they come for. Over our dead bodies, our skulls, our children will they rule. For he, they are coming... Run we must, for all hope his lost. The final hour is upon us, we must ready for when they, he arrives. Flee we must... Flee...
dlga_ddmm5:ddmm6|Who's coming, and how can we defend ourselves? Explain yourself. What do you mean by final hour?
dlga_ddmm6:ddmm7|Deadly they are, a massive army he will bring. Thousands will die, we must run for all hope is lost. DOOMSDAY IS UPON US. The GODS have forsaken us... RUN, HIDE, FLEE those are our only chances. The others are already coming, they will follow them here. They will never stop, he won't let them. They will chase the others until they slaughter all of them, and then they will come for us.
dlga_ddmm7:ddmm8|This is your last chance mad-man. WHO ARE THEY? What do you mean by doomsday?
dlga_ddmm8:ddmm9|The ZANN are coming. The invincible army is crossing the Ocean, they are headed to Perisno. Unstoppable they are, thousands they will bring, thousands more await to cross aswell. We are doomed, we are dead, we stand no chance...

dlga_start:close_window.87|DOOM! DOOMSDAY is COMING!! THE ZANN, they are COMING!! RUN, the gods have FORSAKEN US!
dlga_lord_talk:kramuktalk1|What is the story behind your household troops, the Draharan Ghareebians?.
dlga_kramuktalk1:kramuktalk2|You wish to ask about my pride, my Draharan Ghareebians? Very well. The Draharan Ghareebians are a mix between Western, or 'Ghareebian' culture. They are like the dragoners of the Reich, except they are more nimble and trained by Draharans!
dlga_kramuktalk2:kramuktalk3|Very interesting.
dlga_kramuktalk3:lord_talk|Anything else?
dlga_royal_scribe_introduction:royal_scribe_introduction_1.1|Why, I am the royal scribe of the Elvarie, of course. I chronicle the events and history of our great nation.
dlga_royal_scribe_introduction_1:royal_scribe_elintoran_lore|Could you tell me more about the history of the Elintoran Nation?
dlga_royal_scribe_elintoran_lore:royal_scribe_elintoran_ask|Of course! What would you like to know about?
dlga_royal_scribe_elintoran_ask:royal_scribe_elintoran_ask_king|Queen Arlina.
dlga_royal_scribe_elintoran_ask_king:royal_scribe_elintoran_ask_king_1|Ah. You wish to know about the queen. Well, what can I say? She is a great ruler, although many find her rash and too hotheaded. She was always like that, even as a child. She has led our nation well, but many feel that she shoul not rule because of her age. She is very young and her critics say that she is inexperienced.
dlga_royal_scribe_elintoran_ask_king_1:royal_scribe_elintoran_ask_king_2|Personally, I like the way she rules and I think that there is a bright future for the Elvarie under her leadership. She has proved herself to be very worthy so far. Take her campaign against the Demon Worshippers, for example.
dlga_royal_scribe_elintoran_ask_king_2:royal_scribe_elintoran_ask_king_3|When Arlina took the throne, the Demon Worshippers infested our land like vermin. She led her army personally against the Demon Worhsippers and, one by one destroyed every Demo Worshipper lair she could find. She also strengthened greatly the patrols around the kingdom and we have not had an issue with the Demon Worshippers for a long time.
dlga_royal_scribe_elintoran_ask_king_3:close_window|That was an interesting talk. Goodbye.

dlga_noble_lore_2:lore_3|There are no dragons in this land, unlike where we come from. When we landed on this continent, we thought it would provide more breeding spots and possibly dragon brethren. However, I have called for a long time and there are no Perisno dragons that have responded. I will continue trying, though, and so will all who share my title.

dlga_looters_2:close_window.12|I thought you guys died out ages ago?

dlga_hero_leader_1b:close_window.5|Someday, I will have my revenge.
dlga_looters_2:close_window.14|Until now, I wasn't sure which one of you were worse - the Eagle Brotherhood or the Demon Worshippers. Now I know. At least the Eagle Brotherhood didn't smell as bad.
dlga_start:hero_leader_1a.10|Ahhhhh! Spare me, please! Take anything you want ... just let me live!
dlga_hero_leader_1a:hero_leader_1b.10|Very well.

dlga_hero_leader_1b:close_window.7|We will meet again, someday, and I will make sure to destroy you myself.
dlga_looters_2:close_window.16|I'm not sure if you're crazy, or just stupid.

dlga_political_quest_follow_on:close_window|I think that is a wise move. Good luck to you.
dlga_combined_political_quests:political_quest_suggested.1|Your relations with {s4} are not all that they could be. As {reg4?she:he} is my {s11}, I can mediate to attempt to mend your quarrel. Perhaps the best way for me to do this would be to send {reg4?her:him} a gift -- a fur-trimmed velvet robe, perhaps. If you can provide me with a bolt of velvet and a length of furs, I can have one made and sent to {reg4?her:him.}
dlga_political_quest_follow_on:close_window.1|Splendid. I shall await the materials.
dlga_combined_political_quests:political_quest_suggested.2|As you may realize, {s4} has many enemies among the lords of the {s5}. In particular, they feel that {reg4?she:he} is {s7}, and worry that {reg4?she:he} will {s8}. Were you to denounce {s4} to {reg4?her:his} face, you may reap much popularity -- although, of course, you would make an enemy of {reg4?her:him}, and risk being challenged to a duel.
dlga_combined_political_quests:political_quest_suggested.3|As you may realize, many of us in the peerage of the {s5} consider {s4} to be {s7}, and a liability to our cause. We worry that {reg4?she:he} will {s8}. People know my views on {s4} already, but if you were to denounce {reg4?her:him} to {reg4?her:his} face, you would further erode his standing -- and discourage our liege from entrusting {reg4?her:him} with any more power or responsibility. Of course, you would make an enemy of {reg4?her:him}, and risk being challenged to a duel.{s9}
dlga_political_quest_follow_on:close_window.2|We appreciate what you are doing. I find such intrigues distasteful, but it is all for the good of the {s5}.
dlga_political_quest_follow_on:close_window.3|Very well. It is always risky to involve yourself in intrigues of this sort, but in this case, I think you will benefit.
dlga_combined_political_quests:political_quest_suggested.4|You and I have a common interest in seeking to curtail the rise of {s4}. I feel that {reg4?she:he} is {s7}, and worry that {reg4?she:he} will {s8}. Were you to tell our liege {s9} your opinion of {s4}, it might discourage {s9} from granting {s4} any further powers or responsibilities, at least for a while, and I would be much obliged to you.
dlga_political_quest_follow_on:close_window.4|We appreciate what you are doing. I find such intrigues distasteful, but it is all for the good of the {s5}.

After coming to Perisno, I settled down and built an outpost - this very one, by myself. I raised my own personal army soon enough, with the help of some useful connections and loyal friends. However, local squabbling nobles attacked us and decimated us, even though we won. I hanged the foolish lords who did this. I realized that my life was not going anywhere, so I decided to set up the Freelancer Guild. We are basically mercenaries that are freelancers and help whoever pays us.
dlga_story_3:close_window|Very interesting!
dlga_auggie_buy_1:close_window|No thanks. I have to go.
dlga_start:bounty_1|Do I know you? Did my brother send you?!
dlga_start:bounty_1.1|Do I know you? Did my sister send you?!
dlga_start:bounty_1.2|Do I know you? Did my father send you?!
dlga_start:bounty_1.3|Do I know you? Did my uncle send you?!

dlga_bounty_1:bounty_2|I am looking for a fugitive by the name of {s4}. You fit the description.
dlga_bounty_1:close_window|Nothing. Sorry to trouble you.
dlga_bounty_2:bounty_3|How do I know you're not a bountyhunter?!!
dlga_bounty_3:bounty_4|I can assure you I....
dlga_bounty_4:close_window|Allright so I made a mistake! ONE mistake!! Can't a man start over?!! Do I have to keep on paying?!! HUH?!?! Maybe I should make another mistake!!!
dlga_start:fugitive_1|What do you want?
dlga_fugitive_1:fugitive_2|I am looking for a murderer by the name of {s4}. You fit his description.
dlga_fugitive_1:close_window|Nothing. Sorry to trouble you.
dlga_fugitive_2:fugitive_3|I don't understand, {reg33?madam:sir}. I never killed anyone. I think you've got the wrong man.
dlga_fugitive_3:fugitive_4|Then drop your sword. If you are innocent, you have nothing to fear. We'll go now and talk to your neighbours, and if they verify your story, I'll go on my way.
dlga_fugitive_4:fugitive_5|I'm not going anywhere, friend. You're going to have to fight for your silver, today.
dlga_fugitive_5:fugitive_fight_start|No problem. I really just need your head, anyway.
dlga_fugitive_5:fugitive_fight_start.1|I come not for money, but to execute the law!
dlga_fugitive_5:fugitive_fight_start.2|Alas, that you cannot be made to see reason.
dlga_fugitive_fight_start:close_window|Die, dog!
dlga_member_chat:sacrificed_messenger_1|Yes {reg33?madam:sir}?
dlga_sacrificed_messenger_1:sacrificed_messenger_2|Take this letter to {s1} and give it to {s2}.
dlga_sacrificed_messenger_1:close_window|Nothing. Nothing at all.
dlga_sacrificed_messenger_2:sacrificed_messenger_3|Yes {reg33?madam:sir}. You can trust me. I will not fail you.
dlga_sacrificed_messenger_3:close_window|Good. I will not forget your service. You will be rewarded when you return.
dlga_sacrificed_messenger_3:sacrificed_messenger_cancel|Arggh! I can't do this. I can't send you to your own death!
dlga_sacrificed_messenger_cancel:sacrificed_messenger_cancel_2|What do you mean {reg33?madam:sir}?
dlga_sacrificed_messenger_cancel_2:sacrificed_messenger_cancel_3|There's a trap set up for you in the town. {s3} ordered me to sacrifice one of my chosen warriors to fool the enemy, but he will just need to find another way.
dlga_sacrificed_messenger_cancel_3:close_window|Thank you, {reg33?madam:sir}. I will follow you to the gates of hell. But this would not be a good death.
dlga_start:close_window.91|Don't worry, {reg33?madam:sir}, I'm on my way.
dlga_start:follow_spy_talk|Good day {reg33?madam:sir}. Such fine weather don't you think? If you'll excuse me now I must go on my way.
dlga_follow_spy_talk:follow_spy_talk_2|In the name of {s1}, you are under arrest!
dlga_follow_spy_talk_2:close_window|You won't get me alive!
dlga_follow_spy_talk:close_window|Never mind me. I was just passing by.
dlga_start:spy_partners_talk|Greetings.
dlga_spy_partners_talk:spy_partners_talk_2|In the name of {s1} You are under arrest!
dlga_spy_partners_talk_2:close_window|You will have to fight us first!
dlga_spy_partners_talk:close_window|Never mind me. I was just passing by.
dlga_start:runaway_serf_intro_1|Good day {reg33?madam:sir}.
dlga_runaway_serf_intro_1:runaway_serf_intro_2|I have been sent by your {s4} whom you are running from. He will not punish you if you return now.
dlga_runaway_serf_intro_2:runaway_serf_intro_3|My good {reg33?madam:sir}. Our lives at our village {s1} was unbearable. We worked all day long and still went to bed hungry. We are going to {s6} to start a new life, where we will be treated like humans.
dlga_runaway_serf_intro_3:runaway_serf_go_back|You have gone against our laws by running from your bondage. You will go back to {s1} now!
dlga_runaway_serf_intro_3:runaway_serf_let_go|Well, maybe you are right. All right then. If anyone asks, I haven't seen you.
dlga_runaway_serf_go_back:close_window|All right {reg33?madam:sir}. As you wish. We'll head back to {s5} now.
dlga_runaway_serf_let_go:close_window|God bless you, {reg33?madam:sir}. We will not forget your help.
dlga_start:runaway_serf_reconsider|Good day {reg33?madam:sir}. Don't worry. If anyone asks, we haven't seen you.
dlga_runaway_serf_reconsider:runaway_serf_go_back|I have changed my mind. You must back to your village!
dlga_runaway_serf_reconsider:runaway_serf_let_go|Good. Go quickly now before I change my mind.
dlga_start:runaway_serf_talk_caught|Good day {reg33?madam:sir}. We were heading back to {s5}, but I am afraid we lost our way.
dlga_runaway_serf_talk_caught:runaway_serf_go_back|Do not test my patience. You are going back now!
dlga_runaway_serf_talk_caught:runaway_serf_let_go|Well, if you are that eager to go, then go.
dlga_start:runaway_serf_talk_again_return|We are on our way back to {s5} {reg33?madam:sir}.
dlga_runaway_serf_talk_again_return:runaway_serf_talk_again_return_2|Make haste now. The sooner you return the better.
dlga_runaway_serf_talk_again_return:runaway_serf_talk_again_return_2.1|Good. Keep going.
dlga_runaway_serf_talk_again_return_2:close_window|Yes {reg33?madam:sir}. As you wish.
dlga_start:troublesome_bandits_intro_1|This must be your unlucky day, mate. We're just about the worst people you could run into, in these parts.
dlga_troublesome_bandits_intro_1:troublesome_bandits_intro_2|Heh. For me, you are nothing more than walking money bags. A merchant in {s1} offered me good money for your heads.
dlga_troublesome_bandits_intro_2:close_window|A bounty hunter! Kill {reg33?her:him}! Kill {reg33?her:him} now!
dlga_start:deserter_paid_talk|What do you want? You want to pay us some more money?
dlga_deserter_paid_talk:deserter_paid_talk_2a|Sorry to trouble you. I'll be on my way now.
dlga_deserter_paid_talk_2a:close_window|Yeah. Stop fooling around and go make some money. I want to see that purse full next time I see you.
dlga_deserter_paid_talk:deserter_paid_talk_2b|No. It's your turn to pay me this time.
dlga_deserter_paid_talk_2b:close_window|What nonsense are you talking about? You want trouble? You got it.
dlga_start:deserter_talk|We are the free brothers. We will fight only for ourselves from now on. Now give us your gold or taste our steel.
dlga_deserter_talk:close_window|When I'm done with you, you'll regret ever leaving your army.
dlga_deserter_talk:deserter_barter|There's no need to fight. I am ready to pay for free passage.
dlga_deserter_barter:deserter_barter_2|Good. You are clever. Now, having a look at your baggage, I reckon a fellow like you could pretty easily afford {reg5} aurums. We wouldn't want to be too greedy, now would we? Pay us, and then you can go.
dlga_deserter_barter_2:deserter_barter_3a|All right here's your {reg5} aurums.
dlga_deserter_barter_2:deserter_barter_3b|I don't have that much money with me
dlga_deserter_barter_3b:close_window|Too bad. Then we'll have to sell you to the slavers.
dlga_deserter_barter_3a:close_window|Heh. That wasn't difficult, now, was it? All right. Go now.
dlga_start:tavernkeeper_talk|Good day dear {reg33?madam:sir}. How can I help you?
dlga_tavernkeeper_pretalk:tavernkeeper_talk|Anything else?
dlga_tavernkeeper_talk:tavernkeeper_deliver_wine|I was told to deliver you {reg9} units of {s4}.
dlga_tavernkeeper_deliver_wine:tavernkeeper_pretalk|At last! My stock was almost depleted. I had paid the cost of the {s4} in advance. Here, take these {reg5} aurums. That should cover your pay. And give {s9} my regards. I'll put in a good word for you next time I deal with him.
dlga_tavernkeeper_talk:tavernkeeper_deliver_wine_incomplete|I was told to deliver you {reg9} units of {s4}, but I lost some of the cargo on the way.
dlga_tavernkeeper_deliver_wine_incomplete:tavernkeeper_pretalk|Attacked by bandits eh? You are lucky they left you alive. Anyway, I can pay you no more than {reg5} aurums for this. And I will let {s1} know that my order was delivered less than completely, so you will probably be charged for this loss.
dlga_tavernkeeper_talk:tavernkeeper_deliver_wine_lost|I was told to deliver you {reg9} units of {s4}, but I lost the cargo on the way.
dlga_tavernkeeper_deliver_wine_lost:tavernkeeper_pretalk|What? I was waiting for that {s4} for weeks! And now you are telling me that you lost it? You may rest assured that I will let {s1} know about this.
dlga_tavernkeeper_talk:tavernkeeper_buy_drinks|I'd like to buy every man who comes in here tonight a jar of your best {s0}.
dlga_tavernkeeper_talk:tavernkeeper_coin|I'd like to flip a coin with you.
dlga_tavernkeeper_coin:tavernkeeper_coin2|Alright. How much money do you want to lose?
dlga_tavernkeeper_coin2:tavernkeeper_coin3|50 aurums.
dlga_tavernkeeper_coin2:tavernkeeper_coin3.1|100 aurums.
dlga_tavernkeeper_coin2:tavernkeeper_coin3.2|200 aurums.
dlga_tavernkeeper_coin2:tavernkeeper_coin3.3|500 aurums.
dlga_tavernkeeper_coin2:tavernkeeper_coin3.4|1000 aurums.
dlga_tavernkeeper_coin2:tavernkeeper_coin3.5|2000 aurums.
dlga_tavernkeeper_coin2:tavernkeeper_coinn|I can't afford it.
dlga_tavernkeeper_coinn:tavernkeeper_talk|Nevermind.
dlga_tavernkeeper_coin3:tavernkeeper_coin4|Okay. Head or tail?
dlga_tavernkeeper_coin4:tavernkeeper_coin5|Head.
dlga_tavernkeeper_coin4:tavernkeeper_coin5.1|Tail.
dlga_tavernkeeper_coin5:tavernkeeper_coin6|Well, here we go... (He flips the coin.)
dlga_tavernkeeper_coin6:tavernkeeper_coin6a|Look, it's {s3}! Bad luck for you.
dlga_tavernkeeper_coin6:tavernkeeper_pretalk|Damn, it's {s2}... Here's your money.
dlga_tavernkeeper_coin6a:tavernkeeper_pretalk|Here are your {reg6} aurums.
dlga_tavernkeeper_buy_drinks:tavernkeeper_buy_drinks_2|Of course, my {reg33?lady:lord}. I reckon {reg5} aurums should be enough for that. What should I tell the lads?
dlga_tavernkeeper_buy_drinks_2:tavernkeeper_buy_drinks_end|Let everyone know of the generosity of {playername} to the people of {s10}.
dlga_tavernkeeper_buy_drinks_end:tavernkeeper_pretalk|Don't worry {s0}. Your name will be cheered and toasted here all night.
dlga_tavernkeeper_buy_drinks_2:tavernkeeper_pretalk|Actually, cancel that order.
dlga_tavernkeeper_talk:tavernkeeper_job_ask|Have you heard of anyone in this realm who might have a job for a {reg33?woman:man} like myself?
dlga_tavernkeeper_job_ask:tavernkeeper_job_search|Hmm... Well, {s10} is often looking for mercenaries to fight in {reg0?her:his} wars.{s9}
dlga_tavernkeeper_job_search:tavernkeeper_job_result|Let me think some more...
dlga_tavernkeeper_job_result:tavernkeeper_job_search|I have heard that {s7} {s9}{s10} You may want to speak with {reg4?her:him}.
dlga_tavernkeeper_job_result:tavernkeeper_job_result_2|There may be other work, of course -- lords and guildmasters often have other tasks which we don't hear about. Also, the villages around here frequently need help, although they'd be more likely to pay you with a wedge of cheese and goodwill than with cold hard aurums.
dlga_tavernkeeper_job_result_2:close_window|I'll keep my ears open for other opportunities. You may want to ask again from time to time.
dlga_ransom_broker_sell_prisoners_2:close_window|Be sure to bring me more of your prisoners when you have them.
dlga_ransom_broker_talk:ransom_broker_slaves|I wish to hire some slaves from you.
dlga_ransom_broker_slaves:ransom_broker_slaves1|Great! You can buy them for sixty aurums each - my slaves do not come cheap! With proper training, they may become professional warriors.
dlga_ransom_broker_slaves1:close_window|Nevermind. That's a tad too expensive for me.
dlga_ransom_broker_slaves1:ransom_broker_slaves2|Expensive? That's nothing! I'll buy them.
dlga_ransom_broker_slaves2:ransom_broker_slaves3|Here, take a look at my captives. You can handpick them.
dlga_ransom_broker_slaves3:close_window|Nevermind. Good day.
dlga_ransom_broker_slaves3:ransom_broker_slave_bought|I would like to hire a male slave.
dlga_ransom_broker_slaves3:ransom_broker_slave_bought.1|I would like to hire a female slave.
dlga_ransom_broker_slaves3:ransom_broker_slave_bought.2|I would like to hire 5 male slaves.

dlga_ransom_broker_slaves3:ransom_broker_slave_bought.7|I would like to hire 50 female slaves.
dlga_ransom_broker_slaves3:close_window.1|That is too expensive.
dlga_ransom_broker_slave_bought:close_window|It was nice doing business with you, my friend.
dlga_tavernkeeper_talk:tavernkeeper_bounty|Do you have any larger bounties for me?
dlga_tavernkeeper_bounty:tavernkeeper_bounty1|Why, of course! {s17}
dlga_tavernkeeper_bounty1:requester_talk_3|Can you help?
dlga_requester_talk_3:close_window|No thanks. Maybe next time.
dlga_tavernkeeper_talk:tavernkeeper_bounty_failed|I failed the quest.
dlga_tavernkeeper_talk:tavernkeeper_talk_mercenary_warband_victory|I found these scoundrels and I gave them their punishment!
dlga_tavernkeeper_talk_mercenary_warband_victory:close_window|Good work.  That's your reward. But be careful. People over there are watching you. And I don't think their intentions are good.
dlga_tavernkeeper_talk:tavernkeeper_talk_mysterious_group_victory|I found the mysterious group and I gave them their punishment!
dlga_tavernkeeper_talk_mysterious_group_victory:close_window|Good work.  That's your reward. But be careful. People over there are watching you. And I don't think their intentions are good.
dlga_tavernkeeper_bounty1:tavernkeeper_quest1|The noble said that the prisoners should not be far away and he would reward the person who defeated them handsomely. If you are looking for a bounty, you could defeat the party and report back to me.
dlga_tavernkeeper_quest1:close_window|No thanks. Maybe next time.
dlga_tavernkeeper_quest1:tavernkeeper_quest1_1|I'll do it.
dlga_tavernkeeper_quest1_1:close_window|Excellent! I'll contact the noble and tell him have a reward ready ... if you succeed, of course.
dlga_start:f2.1|Who are you? What do you want?
dlga_f2:close_window.1|You've been causing a lot of trouble around here and I don't have to answer to you. Surrender or die!
dlga_tavernkeeper_talk:tavernkeeper_bounty1_reward|I found the dangerous bandits and I gave them their punishment!
dlga_tavernkeeper_bounty1_reward:close_window|Excellent! I knew that you would succeed. Earlier today, the noble came in and gave me the reward to hand you should you suceed. Of course, he warned me that if I took it for myself he would come after me. So here's your reward.
dlga_tavernkeeper_bounty1:tavernkeeper_quest2|If you are looking for a bounty, you could defeat the party and report back to me.
dlga_tavernkeeper_quest2:close_window|No thanks. Maybe next time.

dlga_tavernkeeper_talk:tavernkeeper_active_mission_1|About the bounty you gave me...
dlga_tavernkeeper_active_mission_1:tavernkeeper_active_mission_2|Yes, have you made any progress on it?
dlga_tavernkeeper_active_mission_2:tavernkeeper_hunt_down_fugitive_success|I found {s4} hiding at {s3} and gave them their punishment.
dlga_tavernkeeper_active_mission_2:tavernkeeper_hunt_down_fugitive_fail|I'm afraid they got away.

dlga_tavernkeeper_active_mission_2:tavernkeeper_mission_failed|I am afraid I won't be able to do this quest.
dlga_tavernkeeper_active_mission_3:tavernkeeper_pretalk|I see. Well why are you still here?

dlga_tavernkeeper_hunt_down_fugitive_success:tavernkeeper_hunt_down_fugitive_success_2|Well done, {playername}!  'Tis good to know you can be trusted to handle things with an appropriate level of tactfulness. A bounty I promised, and a bounty you shall have. 300 aurums and not a copper less!
dlga_tavernkeeper_hunt_down_fugitive_success_2:tavernkeeper_hunt_down_fugitive_reward_accept|Let me take the money, {s65}. Thank you.
dlga_tavernkeeper_hunt_down_fugitive_success_2:tavernkeeper_hunt_down_fugitive_reward_reject|This is blood money. I can't accept it.
dlga_tavernkeeper_hunt_down_fugitive_reward_accept:tavernkeeper_pretalk|Of course, {playername}. Here you are.
dlga_tavernkeeper_hunt_down_fugitive_reward_reject:tavernkeeper_pretalk|You are a {s25} for whom justice is its own reward, eh? As you wish it, {playername}, as you wish it. An honourable sentiment, to be true.
dlga_tavernkeeper_hunt_down_fugitive_fail:tavernkeeper_pretalk|It is a sad day when that {s44} manages to avoid the hand of justice yet again. I thought you would be able to do this, {playername}. Clearly I was wrong.
dlga_tavernkeeper_request_mission_ask:tavernkeeper_tell_mission|So you reckon yourself a bounty hunter, eh?
dlga_tavernkeeper_tell_mission:tavernkeeper_mission_hunt_down_fugitive_told|I have something you could help with, an issue with the lawless villain known as {s4}.  They supposedly murdered someone, or stole something, or....whatever, and have been on the run from their judgement ever since. There is a bounty of 300 aurums on their head. Associates of the murderer who, while they issue them no ill will...reckon that this outlaw may have taken refuge with their kinsmen at {s3}. You might be able to hunt them down and give them what they deserve... ^and claim the bounty for yourself of course.
dlga_tavernkeeper_tell_mission:tavernkeeper_pretalk|I'm sorry, but I don't have any bounties for you right now.
dlga_tavernkeeper_mission_hunt_down_fugitive_told:tavernkeeper_mission_hunt_down_fugitive_accepted|I will claim this bounty.
dlga_tavernkeeper_mission_hunt_down_fugitive_told:tavernkeeper_mission_hunt_down_fugitive_rejected|I am too busy to go after them at the moment.
dlga_tavernkeeper_mission_hunt_down_fugitive_accepted:close_window|That's excellent, {playername}. Their associates will be so grateful to have them....found. And of course the bounty on their head will be yours if you can get...err find them. Well, good hunting to you.
dlga_tavernkeeper_mission_hunt_down_fugitive_rejected:tavernkeeper_pretalk|As you wish, {playername}.I suppose there are plenty of bounty hunters around to get the job done . . .
dlga_tavernkeeper_talk:close_window|I guess I should leave now.
dlga_start:mystic_merchant_talk|Good day {reg33?madam:sir}, I have some items with me. I will sell these items to you in their regular price. You might buy an item in bad shape for a high price, or, perhaps, an item in good shape for a low price. Do you wish to try your fortune?
dlga_mystic_merchant_talk:close_window|That sounds good. I wish to have a try.
dlga_start:ransom_broker_intro|Greetings to you, {s0}. You look like someone who should get to know me.
dlga_ransom_broker_intro:ransom_broker_intro_2|Why is that?
dlga_ransom_broker_intro_2:ransom_broker_info_talk|I broker ransoms for the poor wretches who are captured in these endless wars. Normally I travel between the salt mines and the slave markets on the coast, on commission from those whose relatives have gone missing. But if I'm out on my errands of mercy, and I come across a fellow dragging around a captive or two, well, there's no harm in a little speculative investment, is there? And you look like the type who might have a prisoner to sell.
dlga_ransom_broker_info_talk:ransom_broker_families|What if their families can't pay?
dlga_ransom_broker_families:ransom_broker_info_talk|Oh, then I spin them a few heartwarming tales of life on the galleys. You'd be surprised what sorts of treasures a peasant can dig out of his cowshed or wheedle out of his cousins, assuming he's got the proper motivation! And if in the end they cannot come up with the silver, then there are always slave merchants who are looking for galley slaves. One cannot do Heaven's work with an empty purse, you see.
dlga_ransom_broker_info_talk:ransom_broker_prices|What can I get for a prisoner?
dlga_ransom_broker_prices:ransom_broker_info_talk|It varies. I fancy that I have a fine eye for assessing a ransom. There are a dozen little things about a man that will tell you whether he goes to bed hungry, or dines each night on soft dumplings and goose. The real money of course is in the gentry, and if you ever want to do my job you'll want to learn about every landowning family in Perisno, their estates, their heraldry, their offspring both lawful and bastard, and, of course, their credit with the merchants.
dlga_ransom_broker_info_talk:ransom_broker_ransom_me|Would you be able to ransom me if I were taken?
dlga_ransom_broker_ransom_me:ransom_broker_info_talk|Of course. I'm welcome in every court in Perisno. There's not many who can say that! So always be sure to keep a pot of aurums buried somewhere, and a loyal servant who can find it in a hurry.
dlga_ransom_broker_info_talk:ransom_broker_pretalk|That's all I need to know. Thank you.
dlga_start:ransom_broker_talk|Greetings. If you have any prisoners, I will be happy to buy them from you.
dlga_ransom_broker_pretalk:ransom_broker_talk|Anyway, if you have any prisoners, I will be happy to buy them from you.
dlga_ransom_broker_talk:ransom_broker_sell_prisoners|Then you'd better bring your purse. I have got prisoners to sell.
dlga_ransom_broker_talk:ransom_broker_sell_prisoners_all|I want to sell all the prisoners I have with me.
dlga_ransom_broker_sell_prisoners_all:ransom_broker_sell_prisoners_all_2|Let's see...  I'll give you {reg0} aurums for your {reg1} {reg2?prisoners:prisoner}.  Do we have a deal?
dlga_ransom_broker_sell_prisoners_all_2:ransom_broker_sell_prisoners_2|We have a deal.

dlga_ransom_broker_ransom_companion_name_sum:ransom_broker_ransom_companion_verify|Let me check my ledger, here... Yes. Your friend is being held in the dungeon at {s7}. How interesting! I remember hearing that the rats down there are unusually large -- like mastiffs, they say... Now... For the very reasonable sum of {reg5} denars, which includes both the ransom and my commission and expenses, we can arrange it so that {s5} can once again enjoy {reg4?her:his} freedom.

dlga_ransom_broker_ransom_companion_refuse:ransom_broker_talk|Of course, of course... Never mind what they say about the rats, by the way -- I've never actually seen one myself, on account of the pitch-black darkness.

dlga_start:tavern_traveler_talk|Greetings, friend. You look like the kind of {reg33?person:man} who'd do well to know me. I travel a lot all across Perisno and keep an open ear. I can provide you information that you might find useful. For a meager price of course.
dlga_start:tavern_traveler_lost_companion_thanks|Greetings, {playername}. I saw your companion {s10} at a tavern in {s11} some days ago. I thought you might like to know.
dlga_tavern_traveler_lost_companion_thanks:tavern_traveler_pretalk|Thanks. I'll go and find {reg3?her:him} there.
dlga_tavern_traveler_lost_companion_thanks:tavern_traveler_pretalk.1|Thanks, but I don't really care.
dlga_start:tavern_traveler_talk.1|Greetings, {playername}.
dlga_tavern_traveler_pretalk:tavern_traveler_talk|Yes?
dlga_tavern_traveler_talk:tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms|What can you tell me about this land?
dlga_tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms:tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_2|Perisno is divided into rival kingdoms, which can neither manage to live in peace with their neighbours, nor completely eliminate them. As a result, there's seldom a break to the bitter wars which plague this land and drain its life blood. Well, at least this must be a good place to be for an adventurer such as yourself. With some luck and skill, you can make a name for yourself here, amass a fortune perhaps, or gain great power. Opportunities are endless and so are the rewards, if you are willing to risk your life for them.
dlga_tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_2:tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_3|Tell me more about these opportunities.
dlga_tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_2:close_window|Thank you. That was all I needed to know
dlga_tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_3:tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_4|Well, you probably know everything I could tell you already. You seem to be doing pretty well.
dlga_tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_3:tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_4a|The kingdoms will pay good money for mercenaries if they are engaged in a war. If you have done a bit of fighting, speaking with one of their lords will probably result in being offered a mercenary contract. However the real rewards come if you can manage to become a vassal to a king. A vassal can own villages, castles and towns and get rich with the taxes and revenues of these estates. Normally, only nobles of the realm own land in this way, but in time of war, a king will not hesitate to accept someone who distinguishes {reg33?her:him}self on the battlefield as a vassal, and grant {reg33?her:him} the right to own land.
dlga_tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_4a:tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_4|It is not unheard-of for adventurers to renounce allegiance to a Perisnon king altogether, declare themselves kings, and claim land in their own name. This is a difficult path, however, as the great nobles of the land, with their long ancestries, are not likely to accept such upstarts as their monarch. Such rulers would need to be very careful in establishing their right to rule, or they would be set upon from all sides.
dlga_tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_4:tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_5|It might be easier for an adventurer like yourself to pledge support to an existing king's rival.  There are many such pretenders in Perisno -- those who are born to the right family, who go around and stir up trouble saying they have a better claim to the throne than the current king. If those claim holders could find supporters, they could easily start civil wars and perhaps even replace the king one day.
dlga_tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_5:tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_6|Interesting. Where can I find these claim holders?
dlga_tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_5:close_window|I guess I heard enough already. Thank you.
dlga_tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_6:tavern_traveler_pretalk|A claim holder's life would be in danger in his own country of course. Therefore, they usually stay at rival courts, raising support and hoping to find someone willing to champion their cause. I usually hear news about some of them, and may be able to tell you their location with some precision. But of course, I would ask for a little something for such a service.
dlga_tavern_traveler_talk:tavern_traveler_pretender_location|I want to know the location of a claimant.

dlga_tavern_traveler_person_ask:tavern_traveler_person_ask_2|About whom do you wish to hear?
dlga_tavern_traveler_person_ask_2:tavern_traveler_person_ask_rafklazan|Rafklazan
dlga_tavern_traveler_person_ask_rafklazan:tavern_traveler_person_ask|Ah.. funny you ask about that one. One of my associates was talking about him just the other day as well. Rafklazan is the leader of the Rafkla clan back in his homeland in Nisaynia, where he hails from. He likes to title himself as 'King.' They were raiding another clan, but somehow a wind blew them off course and they were blown away and scattered. For days they sailed until they reached Perisno. He is a formidable one, with a large army. You will need to be careful if you ever venture near Reich or Draharan lands, where he spends most of his time now, wandering around. Rafklazan himself is particularly dangerous. It is said he ripped apart a bear with his bare hands! Can you believe it? Yes, I think you will need to watch yourself if you ever face him in battle. 
dlga_tavern_traveler_person_ask_2:tavern_traveler_person_ask_zeladeck|Zeladeck
dlga_tavern_traveler_person_ask_zeladeck:tavern_traveler_person_ask|Zeladeck, Illica's greatest Falki Knight was not an Illica to begin with. He was an orphan raised by a lumberjack couple , living in the forest near the mountain range of Illica. One day, he found a big injured Falki in the forest, and tended its wound. Nursing the everyday Falki for half a year, Zel and the Falki became best friend. The Falki then regained its strength, and took Zel to the Illica clan, only to reveal that that Falki is a direct descendant of the Sky King, the strongest and most respected Falki. He was 10 by that time. Zeladeck then was trained, and with his gifted ability of a warrior, plus the good teamwork between him and his Falki, he soon became the greatest Falki Knight only at the age of 19. Now, he thinks he is the Chosen One to lead the Falki to victory.
dlga_tavern_traveler_person_ask_2:tavern_traveler_person_ask_octiem|Octiem
dlga_tavern_traveler_person_ask_octiem:tavern_traveler_person_ask|Octiem is an odd one. He is the leader of the fabled Third Legion, who have long been a legend in Perisno. Hundreds of years ago, the Third Legion is said to have ruled the entire world. Octiem believes that he is the one to lead his men to victory, like his ancestors did. He proclaims himself as the one that was chosen to lead and rule the new empire. In reality, he is one delusional bastard who thinks only of himself and has ambitions that are beyond comprehension by the normal man (laughs). Anyway, little is known about him, and it is said that he was born to lead, raised by wolves after being abandoned as a baby. Should you ever fight him, be careful, for his army of loyal followers are very strong.
dlga_tavern_traveler_person_ask_2:tavern_traveler_person_ask_ral_daiun|Ral'Daiun.
dlga_tavern_traveler_person_ask_ral_daiun:tavern_traveler_person_ask|I do not know much about Ral'Daiun. It is said that his title is 'Ral,' and his real name is only Daiun. Ral supposedly means 'Legendary Leader' in the Assassins's wretched dialect. Ral'Daiun is a shadowy figure who have led his assassins to become a huge organization. They have no loyalties and kill for gold and gold only. You won't be seeing Ral'Daiun doing the killing the person, for his assassins do all the dirty work for him while he collects the money. He has a hidden castle somewhere in the mountains, but you will not find it for it is too well hidden. Years ago, the assassins were only a small organization, but now they seem to have quadrupled in size and number. You must be careful fighting them, for they have some new technology in their crossbows.
dlga_tavern_traveler_person_ask_2:tavern_traveler_person_ask_zolona|Zolona
dlga_tavern_traveler_person_ask_zolona:tavern_traveler_person_ask|Ah, Zolona. What can I say about her, hmm? She is the queen of her people, I am told, with the duty of a mountain upon her frail little soldiers. She acts brave and strong, but in reality, she is just a little girl without anyone to guide her. She is the daughter of the dead clain leader of the Syrin Nomads, and she has been chosen to lead her people to salvation. How she will do this is beyond me. You must be careful though, for her honor guard is very strong and can wield the bow better than even the Draharan camel riders. Should you meet her, know that while she is a hard enemy to defeat, she isn't invincible. Also, should you defeat her, remember to show her mercy, for even I feel sorry for her. You should, too.
dlga_tavern_traveler_person_ask_2:tavern_traveler_person_ask_ulfheonar|Ulfheonar.
dlga_tavern_traveler_person_ask_ulfheonar:tavern_traveler_person_ask|Ulfheonar is one of those cursed Volheere raiders. What's more, he is the leader of a large majority of them, and in particular the leader of those Volheere Berserkers. Now, you are young, reckless and headstrong. Word of advice -- don't go looking for Ulf. He and his men are all berserkers without a care or doubt about their own safety. If you fight him, you will most likely lose, and even if you win, you will lose many. Ulf was a Jarl back in Nisaynia where he came from. I think he was chosen as the leader of his people, sent to sail to a new land and populate it. I think he mistook 'populate' for loot and pillage, however, as thousands of men and women can gladly tell you. Now, anything else you would like to know?
dlga_tavern_traveler_person_ask_2:tavern_traveler_person_ask_nibor|Nibor
dlga_tavern_traveler_person_ask_nibor:tavern_traveler_person_ask|Nibor Hood is the leader of the Free-Men rebellion of Tolrania. They are rebelling because they think the Tolranian Government are hypocrites, and I say they are right! Even though I disagree with most of Nibor's methods, the government of Tolrania do need to change. Anyway, enough of me going off topic. Nibor was born and raised in a noble family like his sister, Lady Tylora. He grew sickened by all the flaws in the system and wanted a change. A republic, he said. We need to make Tolrania a republic, and fulfill our founders's wishes. Trouble is, you know what happens when someone wants to overthrow you, right? The King of Tolrania sent his men to kill Nibor, but he escaped, and ever since then he and a band of loyal followers have been wrecking havoc in Tolrania.

dlga_start:minstrel_1|Greetings to you, most noble {reg33?lady:sir}.
dlga_minstrel_1:minstrel_job_description|What is it you do?
dlga_minstrel_1:minstrel_courtship_questions|I have some questions about courtship in Perisno
dlga_minstrel_1:minstrel_courtship_poem|Can you teach me any poems?
dlga_minstrel_courtship_poem:minstrel_courtship_poem_teach|I can teach you the poem, 'The Storming of the Castle of Love.' It is short enough to be easily learned. It is an allegoric poem, replete with symbols and metaphor. It describes how a brave but rough warrior wins the heart of his lady by learning the virtues of chivalry, becoming a true and noble knight. Its theme -- that the role of a woman is to inspire but also civilize a man -- is appreciated by some noble ladies, but not all.
dlga_minstrel_courtship_poem:minstrel_courtship_poem_teach.1|I can teach you the poem, 'The Heart's Desire.' It is a lyrical poem, which can be interpreted either erotically or spiritually. The lover realizes the majesty of the divine by gazing upon the body of his beloved. I believe that it appeals to women of a certain romantic temperament, but you risk scandalizing or boring others.
dlga_minstrel_courtship_poem:minstrel_courtship_poem_teach.2|I can teach you the tale of Kais and Layala. It is a sad and simple story -- the shepherd boy Kais and the nobleman's daughter Layala love each other, but they can never marry. The poem is Kais' lament as he wanders alone, unwilling to forget his true love, driving himself mad with longing. Some ladies melt at the sweetness of his sorrows; others glaze over at his self-pity.
dlga_minstrel_courtship_poem:minstrel_courtship_poem_teach.3|I can teach you part of the saga of Helgerad and Kara. It is a heroic tale, full of blood and battle. The shieldmaiden Kara chooses the warrior Helgered as her lover, as he is the only man who can defeat her in combat. Her father, who pledged her to another, comes with his sons and his huscarls to kill Helgered. They fight, and Helgered and Kara slaughter the entire host except for Kara's beloved younger brother -- who, alas, grows up to avenge his father by slaying Helgered. The depiction of warrior and shieldmaiden as equals will appeal to some women, but a mail-wearing, blood-spattered heroine will shock and repulse others.
dlga_minstrel_courtship_poem:minstrel_courtship_poem_teach.4|I can teach you the poem, 'An Argument in the Garden.' It is a comic poem, which satirizes the conventions of courtly love. A lover steals into a garden in Veluca, and plies her with lots of witty lines to persuade his lover to submit to his embraces. She shoots down all of his advances one by one, then when he is downcast, she takes him in her arms and tells him that she wanted him all along, except on her terms, not his. A lady with a sense of humor may find it amusing, but others might feel that they are the ones who are being mocked.
dlga_minstrel_courtship_poem_teach:minstrel_courtship_poem_teach_2|To teach it to you, I will need some hours of your time -- and, of course, a small fee for my services. About 300 aurums would suffice.
dlga_minstrel_courtship_poem:minstrel_pretalk|I believe you already know the poems I am best equipped to teach.

dlga_minstrel_courtship_poem_teach_3:minstrel_courtship_poem_teach_4.3|Very well -- repeat after me:^   A light pierced the gloom over Wercheg cliffs...^   Where charge of surf broke on shieldwall of shore^   Grey-helmed and grey-cloaked the maiden stood^   On wave-steed's prow, the sailcloth snapping^   Over din of oars, of timbers cracking^   She cried out to her hearth-brothers, arrayed for war
dlga_minstrel_courtship_poem_teach_3:minstrel_courtship_poem_teach_4.4|Very well -- repeat after me:^All the silks of Veluca, all the furs of Khudan^Would buy you not the briefest kiss^What I bestow, I bestow for love^And the sake of my own happiness^But brought you a gift? Let us see! Let us see!^Or should tell my father how you came to see me?

dlga_minstrel_courtship_questions_2:minstrel_player_advice_woo|Having met a lady, how would the suitor woo her?
dlga_minstrel_courtship_questions_2:minstrel_nobles|Tell me about marriage and love among the nobility of Perisno
dlga_minstrel_nobles:minstrel_nobles_2|Nobles are an odd lot. In Perisno, a daughter is a political asset, to be given away to a lord with whom her father wishes to make an alliance. Yet the great families of this land idealize pure love between man and woman, and I have seen many a hardened warrior weep copious tears at the doomed ardour of Sahira and Janun in the songs -- even as he made plans to break his own daughter's heart.
dlga_minstrel_nobles_2:minstrel_nobles_3|Fathers differ, of course. Some Perisnon nobles will let their daughters choose a husband who pleases them. Others, however, feel that to allow their daughters any choice at all would be to diminish their own authority, and insist on imposing a groom whether she likes it or not.
dlga_minstrel_nobles_3:minstrel_prequestions|But the majority will steer a middle course -- they will want to make the final decision about a groom, but will weigh their daughter's preferences heavily. Among other factors, a happy marriage is more likely to produce heirs. So, there is a place for courtship, and for the use of skill and passion to win a lady's heart.
dlga_minstrel_courtship_questions_2:minstrel_daughter_father|What if a lady and her father disagree about a suitor?
dlga_minstrel_daughter_father:minstrel_daughter_father_2|It happens sometimes that a bride elopes. This is a major blow to the father's prestige, leading to lasting enmities. Indeed, it is possible that a war may be fought over a woman. Now, that is a fine topic for a song.
dlga_minstrel_daughter_father_2:minstrel_prequestions|In the end, however, most brides will submit to their parents' choice. A noblewoman's family is everything to her, and few are brave enough to risk its disapproval for the sake of man she barely knows. She may pine for her lover, but still accept the groom -- and without tragic love, what would we have to sing about?
dlga_minstrel_player_role:minstrel_player_role_2|Of course! Perisnon lords make a great deal of lineage, but in the end, lands and money speak louder than one's ancestors. Even though you are a foreigner, if you are coming up in the world, then many parents will consider you a fine catch.
dlga_minstrel_player_role_2:minstrel_player_role_3|You will have to compete with many other lords of your realm, however, who will have an advantage -- they have known these ladies from childhood, and will have been sized up as grooms by carefully discerning mothers and aunts. Some ladies may be fascinated by the stranger, yet opt for the familiar.
dlga_minstrel_player_role_3:minstrel_prequestions|So know this -- you may have your heart broken. But to enter the arena of love fearing heartbreak is like entering the battlefield fearing the enemy's arrows. Be brave, and shrug off the sting of rejection, and victory may yet be yours.
dlga_minstrel_player_role:minstrel_female_player_3|{reg33?Lady:Sir} -- I will speak bluntly. Most of the {reg33?lords:ladies} of this land are looking for a demure {reg33?maiden:lad}, whose skin as fair as snow -- and your skin is burnt brown by the sun. They want a {reg33?maiden:boy} whose voice is soft as bells -- and your voice is hoarse from commanding {reg33?soldiers:men} in battle. Also, although the {reg33?lords:ladies} of Perisno appreciate poems about love, most also want heirs, and few {reg33?women:men} can ride and fight while {reg33?with child:caring for their children}.
dlga_minstrel_female_player_3:minstrel_prequestions|However, not all {reg33?lords:ladies} will be so conventionally minded. We poets sing of shield {reg33?maidens:boys} and of {reg33?huntresses:hunters}, of {reg33?women:lads} who forged their own path without having sacrificed the chance for love. I would not tell you that it would be easy for you to find a devoted {reg33?husband:wife} who will accept your ways, but I would not say that it is impossible.
dlga_minstrel_courtship_questions_2:minstrel_spouse_benefits|What advantage is there in seeking a {reg33?husband:wife}?
dlga_minstrel_spouse_benefits:minstrel_wife_benefits_2|Ah! You are quite the romantic, I see! Well, aside from the obvious benefits of love, companionship and other, em, domestic matters, to marry among the nobility brings great assets. You may forge a strong alliance with the bride's family, and a wife may also assist you in manipulating the politics of the realm to your advantage.
dlga_minstrel_wife_benefits_2:minstrel_prequestions|What's more, most of the great families of Perisno have at some point intermarried with royalty, which would boost your own claim to rule -- should you ever choose to assert it...
dlga_minstrel_spouse_benefits:minstrel_wife_benefits_2.1|Ah! You are quite the romantic, I see! Well, aside from the obvious benefits of love, companionship and other, em, domestic matters, to marry among the nobility brings great assets. You may have access to the groom's castles and properties, and be able to work with him to advance both of your standings in the realm.
dlga_minstrel_player_advice_meet:minstrel_player_advice_meet_2|Every so often, a king or great lord of Perisno will hold a feast. In towns they will often be accompanied by tournaments, and in castles they will be accompanied by hunts. The feasts provide a chance for the lords to repair some of the rivalries that may undermine the strength of the realm. They also provide an opportunity for families to show off their eligible daughters, and ladies will often be allowed to mingle unsupervised with the guests.
dlga_minstrel_player_advice_meet_2:minstrel_prequestions|If you have the opportunity, you may attempt to pay the lady a compliment. This indicates to her that you are a potential suitor, and she will usually know if she wishes you to continue your suit. Incidentally, if you come to her fresh from having distinguished yourself in the tournament or in the hunt, then you may make a stronger first impression than otherwise.
dlga_minstrel_player_advice_woo:minstrel_player_advice_woo_2|To woo a lady takes a certain amount of time and patience, and several meetings spaced over a period of months. A lady who is interested in you will often find ways of letting you know if she wishes you to come visit her. Alternately, you may simply go and ask her father or brother for permission. If you do not have permission from her guardian, it may be possible to arrange an assignation through other means.
dlga_minstrel_player_advice_woo_2:minstrel_player_advice_woo_3|Having arranged an assignment, you may then attempt to charm her and win her favor. Perhaps one of the most difficult aspects of this is finding a topic of conversation. Most Perisno noblewomen lead a cloistered life, at least until they are married, and thus will have little to say that will interest you. On other hand, she will soon tire of hearing of your own deeds in the outside world.
dlga_minstrel_player_advice_woo_3:minstrel_player_advice_woo_4|One time-tested mode of courtship is simply to recite a popular poem, and discuss it. This way, you are both on an equal footing, and neither will have an advantage in knowledge or experience. Of course, different ladies will have different tastes in poetry.
dlga_minstrel_player_advice_woo_4:minstrel_player_advice_woo_5|At some point, you will be able to discuss directly the issue of marriage. She will then let you know if you measure up to what she wants in a husband. Some ladies will coolly assess who is the most prestigious of her suitors, others will be guided by their passions. Some will look to your companions, to see whether you are the kind of husband who will treat her as an equal, while others will follow the lead of their fathers.
dlga_minstrel_player_advice_woo_5:minstrel_prequestions|At any rate, it is a challenging business -- and do not forget, you may find that your suit prospers with a lady, only to have it falter on a father's political ambitions. So you must ask yourself: are you willing to risk disappointment and heartbreak? Alternately, are you willing to throw away your standing in society, to make enemies of allies, in pursuit of a forbidden love? Because if you are, then perhaps some day we will write poems about you.
dlga_minstrel_courtship_questions_2:minstrel_job_description|What is it that you poets and musicians do again?
dlga_minstrel_job_description:minstrel_courtship_prequestions|I compose and write songs for the lords of the land, and their ladies. Sometimes I sing about war, sometimes about the virtues of kings, and sometimes, for the more sophisticated audiences, about the virtues of wine. For most audiences, however, I sing of love.
dlga_minstrel_courtship_questions_2:minstrel_pretalk|No, that is all.
dlga_minstrel_prequestions:minstrel_courtship_questions_2|Do you have any other questions?
dlga_minstrel_pretalk:minstrel_1|Is there anything else?

dlga_merc_recruiter_talk_4:merc_recruiter_talk_5|I do, in fact. I have a problem that seems simple but in reality it's not so much. As you probably know, this town is a main base of operations for me and my people. We are allowed to reside here, but in return we have to provide soldiers for the garrison as well as form town patrols.  We guard the nearby territory and also protect local villages.
dlga_merc_recruiter_talk_5:merc_recruiter_talk_6|Just recently a group of nobles went rogue and took a residence in one of nearby villages. They are pillaging the village and robbing passing caravans, so I was given an order to put an end to this.  Defeating them is not really a problem, but if go against these nobles, we will likely have problems with their friends who can make our life in this town insufferable. And if we do not follow the guildmaster's order, he will terminate our contract.
dlga_merc_recruiter_talk_6:merc_recruiter_talk_7|Sounds like you have to cross a river yet stay dry.

dlga_mercenary_after_recruited:mercenary_after_recruited_2.1|Take your time. We'll be staying in this town for a while.
dlga_mercenary_after_recruited_2:close_window|Yes {reg33?madam:sir}. We'll be ready when you tell us to leave.
dlga_mercenary_tavern_talk:mercenary_tavern_talk_hire|All right. I will hire all of you. Here is {reg5} aurums.
dlga_mercenary_tavern_talk:mercenary_tavern_talk_hire.1|All right. But I can only hire {reg6} of you. Here is {reg5} aurums.
dlga_mercenary_tavern_talk_hire:close_window|{s17}
dlga_mercenary_tavern_talk:tavern_mercenary_cant_lead|That sounds good. But I can't afford to hire any more {reg65?soldiers:men} right now.
dlga_mercenary_tavern_talk:masnerian_lore|Actually, I wish to know about the Masnerian Knights.
dlga_masnerian_lore:masnerian_lore1|As you wish. We, the Masnerian Knights, are a knighthood order that is founded on purely one principle: fight for pay. It is the one single commandment we follow in our lives. We have nothing else. We are trained from an early age in our Order castle, and sent outside to the world to become mercenaries. Our leader is called Lord Ceylius the Dishonorable, the one who inherited the title of Grandmaster of the Masnerian Knights from his father before him. You will find no mercenary who is better at the art of combat than we are, {reg33?madame:sir}.
dlga_masnerian_lore1:close_window|That is very interesting.
dlga_tavern_mercenary_cant_lead:close_window|That's a pity. Well, {reg3?we will:I will} be lingering around here for a while, if you need to hire anyone.
dlga_mercenary_tavern_talk:tavern_mercenary_cant_lead.1|That sounds good. But I can't lead any more {reg65?soldiers:men} right now.
dlga_mercenary_tavern_talk:close_window|Sorry. I don't need any other men right now.
dlga_start:guild_merc_talk|Do you have a need for mercenaries, {reg33?madam:sir}? {reg3?Me and {reg4?{reg3} of my mates:one of my mates} are:I am} looking for a master. We'll join you for {reg5} aurums.
dlga_guild_merc_talk:guild_merc_talk_hire|All right. I will hire all of you. Here is {reg5} aurums.
dlga_guild_merc_talk:guild_merc_talk_hire.1|All right. But I can only hire {reg6} of you. Here is {reg5} aurums.
dlga_guild_merc_talk_hire:close_window|{s17}
dlga_guild_merc_talk:guild_merc_talk_cant_lead|That sounds good. But I can't afford to hire any more soldiers right now.
dlga_guild_merc_talk_cant_lead:close_window|That's a pity. Well, {reg3?we will:I will} be lingering around here for a while, if you need to hire anyone.
dlga_guild_merc_talk:guild_merc_talk_cant_lead.1|That sounds good. But I can't lead any more soldiers right now.
dlga_guild_merc_talk:close_window|Sorry. I don't need any other men right now.
dlga_start:mg_ingvar_main_dialogue|Welcome to the Mercenary Guild, traveller. How can I help you?
dlga_start:mg_ingvar_main_dialogue.1|Welcome again to the Mercenary Guild.
dlga_mg_ingvar_main_dialogue:mg_ingvar_tell_about_guild|What is this place?
dlga_mg_ingvar_tell_about_guild:mg_ingvar_tell_about_guild_1|We call ourselves Mercenary Guild. My name is Ingvar and I am the head of the Guild.
dlga_mg_ingvar_tell_about_guild_1:mg_ingvar_tell_about_guild_2|Here come people from all over the world who for one reason or another abandoned their old life and decided to start anew.
dlga_mg_ingvar_tell_about_guild_2:mg_ingvar_tell_about_guild_3|Some of them left their masters, some of the ran from a war they didn't want to fight. Farmers who want to become warriors, outlaws sick of their former lives, religious people who became disillusioned with their faith.
dlga_mg_ingvar_tell_about_guild_3:mg_ingvar_tell_about_guild_4|We all here have different stories, different backgroud, different training. You can walk around and talk to guys - some of them might decide to join you... provided you can afford to pay for their service, of course.
dlga_mg_ingvar_tell_about_guild_4:mg_ingvar_tell_about_guild_5|Finally, it might interest you that although most people here prefer to stick to their old weapons and trainings, there are always volunteers who I train personally to be good with different weapons - whether it is a shortbow or a longbow, a sword or a mace. Therefore you can equip them however you want, and they won't mind, though more costly equipment will naturally raise their upkeep.
dlga_mg_ingvar_tell_about_guild_5:mg_ingvar_main_dialogue|Is there something else you wish to know?
dlga_mg_ingvar_main_dialogue:mg_ingvar_recruit_custom_mercs|I want to recruit some of those mercenaries you train.
dlga_mg_ingvar_recruit_custom_mercs:mg_ingvar_recruit_custom_mercs_2|Sure, I have a few volunteers.
dlga_mg_ingvar_recruit_custom_mercs_2:mg_ingvar_main_dialogue|Is there something else you want?
dlga_mg_ingvar_main_dialogue:mg_ingvar_goodbye|Actually, I need to go.
dlga_mg_ingvar_goodbye:close_window|All right. If you need something, you can always find me here.
dlga_start:trainer_intro_1|Good day to you {reg33?lass:lad}. You look like another adventurer who has come to try {reg33?her:his} chance in these lands. Well, trust my word, you won't be able to survive long here unless you know how to fight yourself out of a tight spot.
dlga_trainer_intro_1:trainer_intro_2|Thank you for your advice. This place looks like a training field. Maybe I can learn about fighting here?
dlga_trainer_intro_2:trainer_intro_3|Indeed you can. I am a veteran soldier... fought a good deal in the wars in my time. But these days, I train young novices in this area. I can find you some opponents to practice with if you like. Or if you have any questions about the theory of combat, feel free to ask.
dlga_trainer_intro_3:trainer_intro_4a|Yes, I do have a few questions.
dlga_trainer_intro_3:trainer_intro_4b|Actually, I can move on to practice.
dlga_trainer_intro_4a:trainer_talk_combat|Well, ask anything you like.
dlga_trainer_intro_4b:trainer_practice_1|Good. It's good to find someone eager for practice. Let's see what you will do.
dlga_start:trainer_practice_1|That was a good fight. 
dlga_start:trainer_practice_1.1|Ha! Looks like you've developed a bit of a limp there. Don't worry, even losses have their value, provided you learn from them. Shake the stars out of your eyes and get back in there. There's no other way to win.
dlga_start:trainer_talk|Good day. Ready for some training today?
dlga_trainer_pretalk:trainer_talk|Ah, are you ready for some training?
dlga_trainer_talk:trainer_practice_1|I am ready for some practice.
dlga_trainer_talk:trainer_combat_begin|First, tell me something about combat...
dlga_trainer_talk:close_window|I need to leave now. Farewell.
dlga_trainer_combat_begin:trainer_talk_combat|What do you want to know?
dlga_trainer_combat_pretalk:trainer_talk_combat|What else do you want to know?
dlga_trainer_talk_combat:trainer_explain_defense|Tell me about defending myself.
dlga_trainer_talk_combat:trainer_explain_attack|Tell me about attacking with weapons.
dlga_trainer_talk_combat:trainer_explain_horseback|Tell me about fighting on horseback.
dlga_trainer_talk_combat:trainer_pretalk|I guess I know all the theory I need. Let's talk about something else.
dlga_trainer_explain_defense:trainer_explain_defense_2|Good question. The first thing you should know as a fighter is how to defend yourself. Keeping yourself out of harm's way is the first rule of combat, and it is much more important than giving harm to others. Everybody can swing a sword around and hope to cut some flesh, but only those fighters that are experts at defense live to tell of it.
dlga_trainer_explain_defense_2:trainer_explain_defense_3|Now. Defending yourself is easiest if you are equipped with a shield. Just block with your shield. [Hold down the right mouse button to defend yourself with the shield.] In this state, you will be able to deflect all attacks that come from your front. However, you will still be open to strikes from your sides or your back.
dlga_trainer_explain_defense_3:trainer_explain_defense_4|What if I don't have a shield?
dlga_trainer_explain_defense_4:trainer_combat_pretalk|Then you will have to use your weapon to block your opponent. This is a bit more difficult than defending with a shield. Defending with a weapon, you can block against only ONE attack direction. That is, you block against either overhead swings, side swings or thrusts. Therefore you must watch your opponent carefully and start to block AFTER he starts his attack. In this way you will be able to block against the direction of his current attack. If you start to block BEFORE he makes his move, he may just attack in another direction than the one you are blocking against and score a hit.
dlga_trainer_explain_attack:trainer_explain_attack_2|Good question. Attacking is the best defence, they say. A tactic many fighters find useful is taking an offensive stance and readying your weapon for attack, waiting for the right moment for swinging it. [You can ready your weapon for attack by pressing and holding down the left mouse button.]
dlga_trainer_explain_attack_2:trainer_explain_attack_3|That sounds useful.
dlga_trainer_explain_attack_3:trainer_explain_attack_4|It is a good tactic, but remember that, your opponent may see that and take a defensive stance against the direction you are swinging your weapon. If that happens, you must break your attack and quickly attack from another direction [You may cancel your current attack by quickly tapping the right mouse button].
dlga_trainer_explain_attack_4:trainer_explain_attack_5|If my opponent is defending against the direction I am attacking from, I will break and use another direction.
dlga_trainer_explain_attack_5:trainer_combat_pretalk|Yes, selecting the direction you swing your weapon is a crucial skill. There are four main directions you may use: right swing, left swing, overhead swing and thrust. You must use each one wisely. [to control your swing direction with default controls, move your mouse in the direction you want to swing from as you press the left mouse button].
dlga_trainer_explain_horseback:trainer_combat_pretalk|Very good question. A horse may be a warrior's most powerful weapon in combat. It gives you speed, height, power and initiative. A lot of deadly weapons will become even deadlier on horseback. However you must pay particular attention to horse-mounted enemies couching their lances, as they may take down any opponent in one hit. [To use the couched lance yourself, wield a lance or similar weapon, and speed up your horse without pressing attack or defense buttons. after you reach a speed, you'll lower your lance. Then try to target your enemies by maneuvering your horse.]
dlga_trainer_practice_1:trainer_practice_1|I train novices in four stages, each tougher than the one before. To finish a stage and advance to the next one, you have to win three fights in a row.
dlga_trainer_practice_1:novicemaster_are_you_ready|You have passed all stages of training. But if you want you can still practice. Are you ready?
dlga_trainer_practice_1:trainer_practice_1.1|Way to go {reg33?lass:lad}. With this victory, you have advanced to the next training level. From now on your opponents will be regular fighters, not the riff-raff off the street, so be on your toes.
dlga_trainer_practice_1:trainer_practice_1.2|Way to go {reg33?lass:lad}. Welcome to the third training level. From now on your opponents will be veteran fighters; soldiers and arena regulars and the like. These guys know some dirty tricks, so keep your defense up.
dlga_trainer_practice_1:trainer_practice_1.3|You've got the heart of a champion, {reg33?lass:lad}, and the sword arm to match. From now on your opponents will be champion fighters. These are the cream of the crop, the finest warriors I have trained. If you can best three of them in a row, you will join their ranks.
dlga_trainer_practice_1:novicemaster_finish_training|It does my heart good to see such a promising talent. You have passed all tiers of training. You can now tell everyone that you have been trained by the master of the training field.
dlga_novicemaster_finish_training:novicemaster_finish_training_2|Thank you master.
dlga_novicemaster_finish_training_2:close_window|I wish you good luck in the tournaments. And, don't forget,  if you want to practice your swordwork anytime, just come and say the word.
dlga_trainer_practice_1:novicemaster_are_you_ready.1|Your next opponent will be a {s9}. You need to win {reg8} more fights in a row to advance to the next stage. Are you ready?
dlga_novicemaster_are_you_ready:novicemaster_ready_to_fight|Yes I am.
dlga_novicemaster_ready_to_fight:close_window|Here you go then. Good luck.
dlga_novicemaster_are_you_ready:novicemaster_not_ready|Just a minute. I am not ready yet.
dlga_novicemaster_not_ready:close_window|Hey, You will never make it if you don't practice.
dlga_start_craftsman_soon:close_window|Good day, my {reg33?lady:lord}. We hope to begin production in about {reg4} days
dlga_start:master_craftsman_talk|Good day, my {reg33?lady:lord}. We are honored that you have chosen to visit us. What do you require?
dlga_master_craftsman_pretalk:master_craftsman_talk|Very good, my {reg33?lady:lord}. Do you require anything else?
dlga_master_craftsman_talk:master_craftsman_accounts|Let's go over the accounts.
dlga_master_craftsman_talk:master_craftsman_pretalk|Let's check the inventories.
dlga_master_craftsman_talk:master_craftsman_pretalk.1|I'd like you to sell goods as they are produced.
dlga_master_craftsman_talk:master_craftsman_pretalk.2|I'd like you to keep all goods in the warehouse until I arrive.
dlga_master_craftsman_accounts:master_craftsman_pretalk|We currently produce {s3} worth {reg1} aurums each week, while the quantity of {s4} needed to manufacture it costs {reg2}, and labor and upkeep are {reg3}.{s9} This means that we theoretically make a {s12} of {reg0} aurums a week, assuming that we have no raw materials in the inventories, and that we sell directly to the market.
dlga_master_craftsman_talk:master_craftsman_production_options|Could you explain my options related to production?
dlga_master_craftsman_production_options:master_craftsman_production_options_2|Certainly, my {reg33?lady:lord}. Most of the time, the most profitable thing for you to do would be to let us buy raw materials and sell the finished goods directly to the market. Because of our longstanding relations with the local merchants, we can usually get a very good price.
dlga_master_craftsman_production_options_2:master_craftsman_pretalk|However, if you find that you can acquire raw materials cheaper outside {s5}, you may place them in the inventories, and we will use them instead of buying from the market. Likewise, if you feel that you can get a better price for the finished goods elsewhere, then you may ask us to deposit what we produce in our warehouses for you to take.
dlga_master_craftsman_talk:master_craftsman_auction_price|It will no longer be possible for me to continue operating this enterprise.
dlga_master_craftsman_auction_price:master_craftsman_auction_decide|A pity, my {reg33?lady:lord}. If we sell the land and the equipment, and liquidate the inventories, I estimate that we can get {reg4} aurums.
dlga_master_craftsman_auction_decide:master_craftsman_liquidation|That sounds reasonable. Please proceed with the sale.
dlga_master_craftsman_auction_decide:master_craftsman_pretalk|Hmm. Let's hold off on that.
dlga_master_craftsman_liquidation:close_window|As you wish. It was an honor to have been in your employ.
dlga_master_craftsman_talk:close_window.1|That is all for now.
dlga_start:mayor_begin|Good day, {s0}.
dlga_start:mayor_talk|Hello stranger, you seem to be new to {s9}. I am the guild master of the town.
dlga_start:mayor_begin.1|Good day, {playername}.
dlga_mayor_begin:lord_persuade_lords_to_make_peace_completed|{playername}, it was an incredible feat to get {s14} and {s15} make peace, and you made it happen. Your involvement has not only saved our town from disaster, but it has also saved thousands of lives, and put an end to all the grief this bitter war has caused. As the townspeople of {s19}, know that we'll be good on our word, and we are ready to pay the {reg12} aurums we promised.
dlga_lord_persuade_lords_to_make_peace_completed:lord_persuade_lords_to_make_peace_pay|Thank you. Let me have the money.
dlga_lord_persuade_lords_to_make_peace_completed:lord_persuade_lords_to_make_peace_no_pay|No need for a payment. I only did what was right.
dlga_lord_persuade_lords_to_make_peace_pay:close_window|Oh, yes, of course. We had already got the money for you. Here, please accept these {reg12} aurums together with our most sincere thanks. Me and the people of our town will not forget your help.
dlga_lord_persuade_lords_to_make_peace_no_pay:close_window|You are indeed an extraordinary person, {reg33?madame:sir}, and it is an honour for me to have known you. You not only did what was impiossible and put an end to this terrible war, but you won't even accept a reward for it. Very well, I will not insist on the matter, but please know that you will have our eternal respect and gratitude.
dlga_mayor_begin:lord_deal_with_night_bandits_completed|Very nice work, {playername}, you made short work of those lawless curs. Thank you kindly for all your help, and please accept this bounty of 150 aurums.
dlga_lord_deal_with_night_bandits_completed:close_window|It was my pleasure, {s65}.
dlga_mayor_begin:mayor_looters_quest_response|Ah, {playername}. Have you any progress to report?
dlga_mayor_looters_quest_response:mayor_looters_quest_destroyed|I've killed some looters.
dlga_mayor_looters_quest_response:mayor_looters_quest_goods|I've brought you some goods.
dlga_mayor_looters_quest_response:close_window|Not yet, sir. Farewell.
dlga_mayor_looters_quest_destroyed:mayor_looters_quest_destroyed_2|Aye, my scouts saw the whole thing. That should make anyone else think twice before turning outlaw! The bounty is 40 aurums for every band, so that makes {reg1} in total. Here is your money, as promised.
dlga_mayor_looters_quest_destroyed_2:close_window|And that's not the only good news! Thanks to you, the looters have ceased to be a threat. We've not had a single attack reported for some time now.   If there are any of them left, they've either run off or gone deep into hiding. That's good for business,   and what's good for business is good for the town!   I think that concludes our arrangement, {playername}. Please accept this silver as a token of my gratitude. Thank you, and farewell.
dlga_mayor_looters_quest_destroyed_2:mayor_looters_quest_response|Anything else you need?
dlga_mayor_looters_quest_goods:mayor_looters_quest_goods_response|Hah, I knew I could count on you! Just tell me which item to take from your baggage, and I'll send some men to collect it. I still need {reg1} aurums' worth of goods.
dlga_mayor_looters_quest_goods_response:mayor_looters_quest_goods_2|{s5}.
dlga_mayor_looters_quest_goods_response:mayor_looters_quest_goods_3|Nothing at the moment, sir.
dlga_mayor_looters_quest_goods_3:mayor_looters_quest_response|Anything else you need?
dlga_mayor_looters_quest_goods_2:mayor_looters_quest_goods_response|Excellent, here is the money for your {s6}. Do you have any more goods to give me? I still need {reg1} aurums' worth of goods.
dlga_mayor_looters_quest_goods_2:close_window|Well done, {playername}, that's the last of the goods I need. Here is the money for your {s6}, and a small bonus for helping me out. I'm afraid I won't be paying for any more goods, nor bounties on looters, but you're welcome to keep hunting the bastards if any remain. Thank you for your help, I won't forget it.
dlga_mayor_begin:close_window|Good to see you again {playername}. I have heard that you have delivered the cattle successfully. I will tell the merchants how reliable you are. And here is your pay, {reg8} aurums.
dlga_mayor_begin:move_cattle_herd_failed|I heard that you have lost the cattle herd on your way to {s9}. I had a very difficult time explaining your failure to the owner of that herd, {reg33?madam:sir}. Do you have anything to say?
dlga_move_cattle_herd_failed:move_cattle_herd_failed_2|I am sorry. But I was attacked on the way.
dlga_move_cattle_herd_failed:move_cattle_herd_failed_2.1|I am sorry. The stupid animals wandered off during the night.
dlga_move_cattle_herd_failed_2:merchant_ask_for_debts|Well, it was your responsibility to deliver that herd safely, no matter what. You should know that the owner of the herd demanded to be compensated for his loss, and I had to pay him 1000 aurums. So you now owe me that money.
dlga_mayor_begin:close_window.1|{playername} -- I am in your debt for bringing back my friend's daughter.  Please take these {reg8} aurums that I promised you.  My friend wished he could give more but paying that ransom brought him to his knees.
dlga_mayor_begin:mayor_friendly_pretalk|Well -- it sounds like you were able to track down the bandits, and show them what happens to those who would disrupt the flow of commerce. Here is your reward: {reg5} aurums. It is well earned, and we are most grateful.
dlga_mayor_begin:mayor_friendly_pretalk.1|I have heard about your deeds. You have given those bandits the punishment they deserved. You are really as good as they say. Here is your reward: {reg5} aurums. I would like to give more but those bandits almost brought me to bankruptcy.
dlga_mayor_begin:merchant_ask_for_debts|According to my accounts, you owe the merchants guild {reg1} aurums. I'd better collect that now.
dlga_merchant_ask_for_debts:merchant_debts_paid|Alright. I'll pay my debt to you.
dlga_merchant_debts_paid:mayor_pretalk|Excellent. I'll let my fellow merchants know that you are clear of any debts.
dlga_merchant_ask_for_debts:merchant_debts_not_paid|I'm afraid I can't pay that sum now.
dlga_merchant_debts_not_paid:close_window|In that case, I am afraid, I can't deal with you. Guild rules... Come back when you can pay the {reg1} aurums. And know that we'll be charging an interest to your debt. So the sooner you pay it, the better.
dlga_mayor_begin:mayor_talk|What can I do for you?
dlga_mayor_friendly_pretalk:mayor_talk|Now... What else may I do for you?
dlga_mayor_pretalk:mayor_talk|Yes?
dlga_mayor_talk:mayor_info_begin|Can you tell me about what you do?
dlga_mayor_talk:merchant_quest_requested|Do you happen to have a job for me?
dlga_mayor_talk:merchant_quest_last_offered_job|About that job you offered me...
dlga_mayor_talk:merchant_quest_about_job|About the job you gave me...
dlga_mayor_talk:mayor_political_talk|I have some questions of a political nature.
dlga_mayor_talk:mayor_economy_report_1|How is trade around here?
dlga_mayor_talk:mayor_wealth_comparison_1|How does the wealth of this region compare with the rest of Perisno?
dlga_mayor_talk:mayor_investment_possible|I wish to buy land in this town for a productive enterprise
dlga_mayor_investment_possible:mayor_pretalk|You already operate a {s4} here. There probably aren't enough skilled tradesmen to start a second enterprise.
dlga_mayor_investment_possible:mayor_pretalk.1|{s9}
dlga_mayor_investment_possible:mayor_investment_advice.1|Of course, {s0}. You are the lord of this town, and no one is going to stop you.
dlga_mayor_investment_possible:mayor_investment|Well... Given your relationship with our liege, {s4}, I think that you will not find many here who are brave enough to sell you any land.
dlga_mayor_investment_possible:mayor_pretalk.2|Well... To be honest, I think that we in the guild would like to know you a little better. We can be very particular about outsiders coming in here and buying land.
dlga_mayor_investment_possible:mayor_investment_advice.2|Very good, {s0}. We in the guild know and trust you, and I think I could find someone to sell you the land you need.
dlga_mayor_investment_advice:investment_choose_enterprise|A couple of things to keep in mind -- skilled laborers are always at a premium, so I doubt that you will be able to open up more than one enterprise here. In order to make a profit for yourself, you should choose a commodity which is in relatively short supply, but for which the raw materials are cheap. What sort of enterprise would you like to start?
dlga_investment_choose_enterprise:investment_summary|A mill and bakery, to make bread from grain
dlga_investment_choose_enterprise:investment_summary.1|A brewery, to make ale from grain
dlga_investment_choose_enterprise:investment_summary.2|A tannery, to make leather from hides
dlga_investment_choose_enterprise:investment_summary.3|A wine press, to make wine from grapes
dlga_investment_choose_enterprise:investment_summary.4|An oil press, to make oil from olives
dlga_investment_choose_enterprise:investment_summary.5|An ironworks, to make tools from iron
dlga_investment_choose_enterprise:investment_summary.6|A weavery and dyeworks, to make velvet from silk and dye
dlga_investment_choose_enterprise:investment_summary.7|A weavery, to make wool cloth from wool
dlga_investment_choose_enterprise:investment_summary.8|A weavery, to make linen from flax
dlga_investment_choose_enterprise:mayor_pretalk|Never mind
dlga_investment_summary:mayor_investment_confirm|Very good, {reg33?Madame:Sir}. The land and the materials on which you may build your {s3} will cost you {reg7} aurums. Right now, your {s3} will produce {s4} worth {reg1} aurums each week, while the {s6} needed to manufacture that batch will be {reg2} and labor and upkeep will be {reg3}.{s9} I should guess that your profit would be {reg0} aurums a week. This assumes of course that prices remain constant -- which, I can virtually guarantee you, they will not. Do you wish to proceed?
dlga_mayor_investment_confirm:mayor_investment_purchase|Yes. Here is money for the land.
dlga_mayor_investment_confirm:mayor_pretalk|No -- that's not economical for me at the moment.
dlga_mayor_investment_purchase:mayor_pretalk|Very good. Your enterprise should be up and running in about a week. When next you come, and thereafter, you should speak to your {s4} about its operations.
dlga_mayor_talk:close_window|[Leave]
dlga_mayor_info_begin:mayor_info_talk|I am the guildmaster of {s9}. You can say I am the leader of the good people of {s9}. I can help you find a job if you are looking for some honest work.
dlga_mayor_info_talk:mayor_info_lord|Who rules this town?
dlga_mayor_info_lord:mayor_info_talk|Our town's lord and protector is {s10}. {reg0?She:He} owns the castle and sometimes resides there, and collects taxes from the town. However we regulate ourselves in most of the matters that concern ourselves. As the town's guildmaster I have the authority to decide those things.
dlga_mayor_info_talk:mayor_pretalk|That's all I need to know. Thanks.
dlga_mayor_political_talk:mayor_political_questions|Politics? Good heaven, the guild has nothing to do with politics. We are loyal servants of {s10}. We merely govern our own affairs, and pass on the townspeople's concerns to our lords and masters, and maybe warn them from time to time against evil advice. Anyway, what did you wish to ask?
dlga_mayor_prepolitics:mayor_political_questions|Did I mention that we here are all {s9}? Because I can't stress that enough... Anyway... Is there anything else?
dlga_mayor_political_questions:mayor_war_description_1|What is the cause of all these wars in Perisno?
dlga_mayor_war_description_1:mayor_war_description_2|Well, to answer your question generally, each monarch claims to be the rightful heir to the old Perisno emperors. Some of these claims are based on forgotten dynastic marriages and others are based on obscure promises, while {s22} Elves invoke the empire's unwritten constitution. So in theory, any one realm has the right to declare war on any other realm at any time.
dlga_mayor_war_description_2:mayor_war_description_3|In practice, to make war is exhausting work. It is easy enough to lay waste to the enemy's farmland, but crops will grow back, and it is a far different matter to capture an enemy stronghold and to hold it. So the monarchs of Perisno will fight a little, sign a truce, fight a little more, and so on and so forth. Often, a monarch will go to war when another realm provokes them. At such times, some bad influences who look to enrich themselves with ransoms and pillage will clamor for retribution, and thus the damage caused by war to a monarch's treasury is less than the damage caused by doing nothing would be to his authority... I'm of course not talking about {s10}, as no one would ever question {reg4?her:his} authority
dlga_mayor_war_description_3:mayor_war_description_4|I would stress again that we in the guild have nothing to do with politics. But if {s10} were to ask for my advice on these matters, as a loyal subject, I would tell {reg4?her:him} that while {reg4?her:his} claim to all of Perisno is truly just, even the most legitimate claim must be backed by armed men, and armed men want money, and money comes from trade, and war ruins trade, so sometimes the best way to push a claim is not to push it, if you know what I mean...
dlga_mayor_war_description_4:mayor_prepolitics|You may tell {s10} this if you see {reg4?her:him}. Don't mention my name specifically -- just say 'the people of {s4}' told you this. Our personal opinion, of course, as to what would be in {s10}'s best interests. None of us would ever dream of questioning a monarch's sovereign right to push {reg4?her:his} legitimate claims.
dlga_mayor_political_questions:mayor_politics_assess|What is {s10}'s policy in regards to the other realms of Perisno?
dlga_mayor_politics_assess:mayor_politics_assess_realm|Which realm did you have in mind?
dlga_mayor_politics_assess_realm:mayor_politics_give_realm_assessment|{s11}
dlga_mayor_politics_give_realm_assessment:mayor_prepolitics|{s14}
dlga_mayor_political_questions:mayor_internal_politics|What can you say about the internal politics of the realms?
dlga_mayor_internal_politics:mayor_internal_politics_2|Well, here in the {s4} we are all united by our love for {s5} and support for {reg4?her:his} legitimate claim to the rulership of all Perisno. But I have heard some talk of internal bickering in other realms...
dlga_mayor_internal_politics_2:mayor_internal_politics_3|The lords of a realm often have very different ideas about honor, strategy, and the way a nobleman should behave. In addition, they compete with each other for the ruler's favor, and are constantly weighing up their position -- how they stand, how their friends and family stand, and how their enemies stand.
dlga_mayor_internal_politics_3:mayor_internal_politics_4|Underlying all the tensions is the possibility that a lord may abandon his liege, and pledge vassalhood to another. In theory, each lord has sworn an oath of vassalage, but in practice, a vassal can always find an excuse to absolve himself. The vassal may claim that the liege has failed to hold up his end of the bargain, to protect the vassal and treat him justly. Or, the vassal may claim that his liege is in fact a usurper, and another has a better claim to the kingship.
dlga_mayor_internal_politics_4:mayor_internal_politics_5|Lieges and vassals still watch each other carefully. If a king believes that his vassal is going to change sides or rebel, he may indict the vassal for treason and seize his properties. Likewise, if a vassal fears that he will be indicted, he may rebel. Usually, whoever makes the first move will be able to control the vassal's fortresses.
dlga_mayor_internal_politics_5:mayor_prepolitics|Now, men do not trust a vassal who turns coat easily, nor do they trust a king who lightly throws around charges of treason. Those two factors can keep a realm together. But if relations between a vassal and a liege deteriorate far enough, things can become very tense indeed... In other lands, of course. These things could never happen here in the {s4}.
dlga_mayor_political_questions:mayor_pretalk|That is all. Thank you.
dlga_merchant_quest_about_job:merchant_quest_about_job_2|What about it?
dlga_merchant_quest_about_job_2:merchant_quest_what_if_fail|What if I can't finish it?
dlga_merchant_quest_about_job_2:merchant_quest_about_job_working|Well, I'm still working on it.
dlga_merchant_quest_about_job_working:mayor_pretalk|Good. I'm sure you will handle it.
dlga_merchant_quest_last_offered_job:merchant_quest_brief|Eh, you want to reconsider that. Good...
dlga_merchant_quest_what_if_fail:mayor_pretalk|I hope you don't fail. In that case, I'll have to ask for the price of the cargo you were carrying.
dlga_merchant_quest_what_if_fail:mayor_pretalk.1|Well, just do your best to finish it.
dlga_merchant_quest_taken:mayor_pretalk|Excellent. I am counting on you then. Good luck.
dlga_merchant_quest_stall:mayor_pretalk|Well, the job will be available for a few more days I guess. Tell me if you decide to take it.

dlga_merchant_quest_requested:merchant_quest_brief|Well, you look able enough. I think I might have something you could do.
dlga_merchant_quest_brief:merchant_quest_looters_choice|We've had some fighting near the {s5} lately, with all the chaos that comes with it, and that's led some of our less upstanding locals to try and make their fortune out of looting the shops and farms during the confusion. A lot of valuable goods were taken. I need somebody to teach those bastards a lesson. Sound like your kind of work?
dlga_merchant_quest_looters_choice:merchant_quest_looters_brief|Aye, I'll do it.
dlga_merchant_quest_looters_choice:merchant_quest_stall|I'm afraid I can't take the job at the moment.
dlga_merchant_quest_looters_brief:close_window|Excellent! You'll find the looters roaming around the countryside, probably trying to rob more good people. Kill or capture the bastards, I don't care what you do with them. I'll pay you a bounty of 40 aurums on every band of looters you destroy, until all the looters are dealt with.
dlga_merchant_quest_requested:merchant_quest_explain_2|Well, there is a very great favor which you could do us... As you may have heard, some {s10}s have come across the border to attack our people. {s5} is under great pressure from some of the more bellicose of {reg0?her:his} vassals to respond with a declaration of war. Unfortunately, while the great lords of this land grow rich from bloodshed, we of the commons will be caught in the middle, and will suffer.
dlga_merchant_quest_explain_2:merchant_quest_brief|We are not saying that {s5} should overlook this aggression -- far from it! But if {reg0?she:he} charges one of {reg0?her:his} own lords to respond, then the cycle of provocation will necessarily lead to a full-fledged confrontation. Now, if an outsider were to step in and defeat a {s10} lord in battle, then honor would be done, and it would defuse the clamor for war. If the defeated lord were a known troublemaker -- {s7} -- then the {s10}s might be able to overlook it.
dlga_merchant_quest_brief:merchant_quest_retaliate_confirm|We need you to attack and defeat {s7}. This will not be an easy task, and that outsider would damage {reg33?her:his} relationship with the {s10}s, but we would be very grateful. We could not acknowledge a connection with that outsider, but we could be sure that {reg33?she:he} would be handsomely rewarded... Could you do this?
dlga_merchant_quest_retaliate_confirm:merchant_quest_track_bandits_brief|Aye, I can do it.
dlga_merchant_quest_retaliate_confirm:merchant_pretalk|I would prefer not to get mixed up in such things
dlga_destroy_lair_quest_brief:merchant_quest_track_bandit_lair_choice|The raiders are likely to have laid up their ships in a well-concealed cove, somewhere along the coastline, preferably next to a small stream where they have some water. The best way to discover its location would be to find a group of sea raiders who appear to be heading back to their base to resupply, and follow them.
dlga_destroy_lair_quest_brief:merchant_quest_track_bandit_lair_choice.1|Bandits such as these usually establish their hideouts in the foothills on the edge of the desert, often in a canyon near a spring. This gives them both water and concealment. The best way to discover its location would be to find a group of desert bandits who appear to be heading back to their base to resupply, and follow them.
dlga_destroy_lair_quest_brief:merchant_quest_track_bandit_lair_choice.2|Bandits such as these will usually establish a base in the highlands, often on an steep ledge where they have a view of the surrounding countryside. This makes them difficult to surprise. The best way to discover its location would be to find a group of mountain bandits who appear to be heading back to their base to resupply, and follow them.
dlga_destroy_lair_quest_brief:merchant_quest_track_bandit_lair_choice.3|Bandits such as these will usually set up their encampments deep in the woods, sometimes in the middle of a swamp. The best way to discover its location would be to find a group of forest bandits who appear to be heading back to their base to resupply, and follow them.
dlga_destroy_lair_quest_brief:merchant_quest_track_bandit_lair_choice.4|Bandits such as these will usually set up their encampments in the woodland on the steppe, where they have some concealment.

dlga_destroy_lair_quest_brief:merchant_quest_track_bandit_lair_choice.5|Bandits such as these will usually set up their encampments deep in the woods. The best way to discover its location would be to find a group of tundra bandits who appear to be heading back to their base to resupply, and follow them.
dlga_merchant_quest_track_bandit_lair_choice:merchant_quest_destroy_lair_brief|Aye, I'll do it.
dlga_merchant_quest_track_bandit_lair_choice:lord_pretalk|I'm afraid I can't take the job at the moment.
dlga_merchant_quest_destroy_lair_brief:close_window|Very good. We will await word of your success.

dlga_merchant_quest_brief:merchant_quest_track_bandits_choice|We would like you to track these {s4} down. The merchants of the town were able to get a description of their leader, and have put together a bounty. If you can hunt them down and destroy them, we'll make it worth your while...
dlga_merchant_quest_track_bandits_choice:merchant_quest_track_bandits_brief|Aye, I'll do it.
dlga_merchant_quest_track_bandits_brief:close_window|Very good. The band may not have lingered long in the area, but chances are that they will be spotted by other travellers on the road.

dlga_merchant_quest_requested:merchant_quest_brief.2|You're looking for a job? Actually I was looking for someone to deliver some {s4}. Perhaps you can do that...

dlga_merchant_quest_brief_deliver_wine:merchant_quest_stall|I am afraid I can't carry all that cargo now.
dlga_merchant_quest_requested:merchant_quest_brief.3|You're looking for a job? Actually I was looking for someone to escort a caravan. Perhaps you can do that...
dlga_merchant_quest_brief:escort_merchant_caravan_quest_brief|I am going to send a caravan of goods to {s8}. However with all those bandits and deserters on the roads, I don't want to send them out without an escort. If you can lead that caravan to {s8} in 15 days, you will earn {reg8} aurums. Of course your party needs to be at least {reg4} strong to offer them any protection.
dlga_escort_merchant_caravan_quest_brief:merchant_quest_taken|Alright. I will escort the caravan.
dlga_escort_merchant_caravan_quest_brief:merchant_quest_stall|I am afraid I don't have that many soldiers with me.

dlga_merchant_caravan_stay_here:close_window|Alright. We'll be waiting here for you.
dlga_merchant_quest_requested:merchant_quest_brief.4|Actually, I was looking for an able adventurer like you. There's this group of particularly troublesome bandits. They have infested the vicinity of our town and are preying on my caravans. They have avoided all the soldiers and the militias up to now. If someone doesn't stop them soon, I am going to be ruined...
dlga_merchant_quest_brief:troublesome_bandits_quest_brief|I will pay you {reg8} aurums if you hunt down those troublesome bandits. It's dangerous work. But I believe that you are the {reg33?one:man} for it. What do you say?

dlga_merchant_quest_taken_bandits:close_window|You will? Splendid. Good luck to you.

dlga_merchant_quest_requested:merchant_quest_brief.5|Actually, I was looking for a reliable {reg33?helper:man} that can undertake an important mission. A group of bandits have kidnapped the daughter of a friend of mine and are holding her for ransom. My friend is ready to pay them, but we still need someone to take the money to those rascals and bring the girl back to safety.
dlga_merchant_quest_brief:kidnapped_girl_quest_brief|The amount the bandits ask as ransom is {reg12} aurums. I will give you that money once you accept to take the quest. You have 15 days to take the money to the bandits who will be waiting near the village of {s4}. Those bastards said that they are going to kill the poor girl if they don't get the money by that time. You will get your pay of {reg8} aurums when you bring the girl safely back here.
dlga_kidnapped_girl_quest_brief:kidnapped_girl_quest_taken|All right. I will take the ransom money to the bandits and bring back the girl.
dlga_kidnapped_girl_quest_taken:close_window|Good. I knew we could trust you at this. Here is the ransom money, {reg12} aurums. Count it before taking it. And please, don't attempt to do anything rash. Keep in mind that the girl's well being is more important than anything else...

dlga_merchant_quest_brief:merchant_quest_persuade_peace_3|There have been attempts to reconcile the two sides and reach a settlement.

dlga_merchant_quest_persuade_peace_6:merchant_quest_persuade_peace_7|There is a way to resolve the issue.

dlga_merchant_quest_persuade_peace_9:merchant_quest_persuade_peace_10|All right. I will do my best.
dlga_merchant_quest_persuade_peace_9:merchant_quest_persuade_peace_no|Sorry. I can not do this.

dlga_start:village_elder_deliver_cattle_thank|My good {reg33?madam:sir}. Our village is grateful for your help. Thanks to the {reg5} heads of cattle you have brought, we can now raise our own herd.
dlga_village_elder_deliver_cattle_thank:village_elder_talk|My good {reg33?lady:lord}, please, is there anything I can do for you?
dlga_start:village_elder_talk|Welcome to {s9}, {s0}. We were rejoiced by the news that you are the new {reg33?Lady:Lord} of our humble village. I am the village elder and I will be honoured to serve you in any way I can.
dlga_start:village_elder_talk.1|Good day, {s0}, and welcome to {s9}. I am the elder of this village.
dlga_start:village_elder_talk.2|Your highness, you honour our humble village with your presence.
dlga_start:village_elder_talk.3|My {reg33?Lady:Lord}, you honour our humble village with your presence.
dlga_start:village_elder_talk.4|Good day, {s0}.
dlga_village_elder_pretalk:village_elder_talk|Is there anything else I can do for you?
dlga_village_elder_talk:village_elder_ask_fugitive|I am looking for a man by the name of {s4}. I was told he may be hiding here.
dlga_village_elder_ask_fugitive:village_elder_pretalk|Strangers come and go to our village, {s0}. But I doubt you'll run into him at this hour of the night. You would have better luck during the day.
dlga_village_elder_ask_fugitive:close_window|Strangers come and go to our village, {s0}. If he is hiding here, you will surely find him if you look around.
dlga_village_elder_talk:village_elder_active_mission_1|About the task you asked of me...
dlga_village_elder_talk:village_elder_request_mission_ask|Do you have any tasks I can help you with?
dlga_village_elder_talk:village_elder_trade_begin|I want to buy some supplies. I will pay with gold.
dlga_village_elder_trade_begin:village_elder_trade_talk|Of course, {reg33?Madam:Sir}. Do you want to buy goods or cattle?
dlga_village_elder_trade_talk:village_elder_trade|I want to buy food and supplies.
dlga_village_elder_trade:village_elder_pretalk|We have some food and other supplies in our storehouse. Come have a look.
dlga_village_elder_trade_talk:village_elder_buy_cattle|I want to buy some cattle.
dlga_village_elder_trade_talk:village_elder_pretalk|I changed my mind. I don't need to buy anything.
dlga_village_elder_talk:village_sponsor|I'd like to help your village with some money (7000 aurums).
dlga_village_sponsor:village_elder_talk|Oh my... I mean, thank you, {s0}. This is very generous of you.
dlga_village_elder_talk:send_reinf_to_fief1|I want to send troops to one of my fiefs and I want you to provide them with food.
dlga_send_reinf_to_fief1:send_reinf_to_fief2|Aye {s0}. Where would you like to send them?
dlga_send_reinf_to_fief2:send_reinf_to_fief3|{s12}
dlga_send_reinf_to_fief2:close_window|Never mind.
dlga_send_reinf_to_fief3:send_reinf_to_fief4|Who would you like to send, {s0}?
dlga_send_reinf_to_fief4:send_reinf_to_fief4_1|Hmm...
dlga_send_reinf_to_fief4_1:send_reinf_to_fief5|That will be {reg1} aurums for the food for your soldiers, {s0}.
dlga_send_reinf_to_fief4_1:village_elder_talk|Oh, I see you changed your mind... do you wish something else?
dlga_send_reinf_to_fief5:send_reinf_to_fief6|Here is the money (give {reg1} aurums).
dlga_send_reinf_to_fief5:close_window|Actually, never mind.
dlga_send_reinf_to_fief6:close_window|Thank you, {s0}, I'll provide your soldiers with enough supplies.
dlga_start:send_troops_tweak_party_conv_reply|Greetings, commander!
dlga_send_troops_tweak_party_conv_reply:close_window|You have your orders. Keep moving.
dlga_village_elder_talk:village_elder_ask_enemies|Have you seen any enemies around here recently?
dlga_village_elder_ask_enemies:village_elder_pretalk|I am sorry, {s0}. We have neither seen nor heard of any war parties in this area.
dlga_village_elder_ask_enemies:village_elder_tell_enemies|Hmm. Let me think about it...
dlga_village_elder_tell_enemies:village_elder_tell_enemies|{s1} {s2}
dlga_village_elder_tell_enemies:village_elder_pretalk|No, {s0}. We haven't seen any war parties in this area for some time.
dlga_village_elder_tell_enemies:village_elder_pretalk.1|Well, I guess that was all.
dlga_village_elder_talk:village_elder_ask_set_fire|I need you to set a large fire on the outskirts of this village.
dlga_village_elder_ask_set_fire:close_window|We have already agreed upon this, {s0}. I will do my best. You can trust me.
dlga_village_elder_ask_set_fire:village_elder_ask_set_fire_1|A fire, {s0}! Fires are dangerous! Why would you want such a thing?
dlga_village_elder_ask_set_fire:village_elder_ask_set_fire_5|I believe that we have already discussed this issue, {s0}.
dlga_village_elder_ask_set_fire:village_elder_ask_set_fire_5.1|We talked about this before {s0} and your previous offers were low compared to risk you want me to take.
dlga_village_elder_ask_set_fire_1:village_elder_ask_set_fire_2|I have my reasons, and you will have yours -- a purse of silver. Will you do it, or not?
dlga_village_elder_ask_set_fire_1:village_elder_ask_set_fire_explain_plan|Given the risk you are taking, you are entitled to know my plan.
dlga_village_elder_ask_set_fire_explain_plan:village_elder_ask_set_fire_2|I wish to rescue a prisoner from {s4}. When you light the fire, the guards in {s4} will see the smoke, and some of them will rush outside to see what is going on. 
dlga_village_elder_ask_set_fire_2:village_elder_ask_set_fire_9|As you wish, {s0}. You have been a good friend to this village, and, even though there is a risk, we should be glad to return the favor. When do you want this fire to start?
dlga_village_elder_ask_set_fire_2:close_window|I'm sorry, {s0}. You will forgive me for saying this, but we don't exactly have good reason to trust you. This is too dangerous.
dlga_village_elder_ask_set_fire_2:village_elder_ask_set_fire_3|As you say, {s0}. But in doing this, we are taking a very great risk. What's in it for us?
dlga_village_elder_ask_set_fire_3:village_elder_ask_set_fire_4|I can give you 100 aurums.
dlga_village_elder_ask_set_fire_3:village_elder_ask_set_fire_6|I can give you 200 aurums.
dlga_village_elder_ask_set_fire_3:village_elder_ask_set_fire_6.1|I can give you 300 aurums.
dlga_village_elder_ask_set_fire_3:close_window|Never mind.
dlga_village_elder_ask_set_fire_4:village_elder_talk|This is madness. I cannot take such a risk.
dlga_village_elder_ask_set_fire_5:village_elder_ask_set_fire_7|Then let's increase your reward to 200 aurums.
dlga_village_elder_ask_set_fire_5:village_elder_ask_set_fire_6|Then let's increase your reward to 300 aurums.
dlga_village_elder_ask_set_fire_5:village_elder_ask_set_fire_6.1|Then let's increase your reward to 300 aurums. This is my last offer.
dlga_village_elder_ask_set_fire_5:close_window|Never mind.
dlga_village_elder_ask_set_fire_6:village_elder_ask_set_fire_9|Very well. You are asking me to take a very great risk, but I will do it. When do you want this fire to start?
dlga_village_elder_ask_set_fire_7:village_elder_talk|I cannot do such a dangerous thing for 200 aurums.
dlga_village_elder_ask_set_fire_9:village_elder_ask_set_fire_10|Continue with your preparations. One hour from now, I need that fire.
dlga_village_elder_ask_set_fire_9:village_elder_ask_set_fire_11|Do this in at the stroke of midnight. I will wait exactly one hour.
dlga_village_elder_ask_set_fire_10:close_window|Very well, {reg33?my Lady:Sir}. We will make our preparations. Now you make yours.
dlga_village_elder_ask_set_fire_11:close_window|As you wish, {reg33?my Lady:Sir}. May the heavens protect you.
dlga_village_elder_talk:village_elder_recruit_start|Are there any lads from this village who might want to seek their fortune in the wars?
dlga_village_elder_talk:close_window|[Leave]
dlga_village_elder_buy_cattle:village_elder_buy_cattle_2|We have {reg5} heads of cattle, each for {reg6} aurums. How many do you want to buy?
dlga_village_elder_buy_cattle:village_elder_buy_cattle_2.1|I am afraid we have no cattle left in the village {reg33?Madam:Sir}.

dlga_village_elder_buy_cattle_2:village_elder_pretalk|Forget it.
dlga_village_elder_buy_cattle_complete:village_elder_pretalk|I will tell the herders to round up the animals and bring them to you, {reg33?Madam:Sir}. I am sure you will be satisfied with your purchase.
dlga_village_elder_recruit_start:village_elder_talk|I don't think anyone would be interested, {reg33?Madam:Sir}. Is there anything else I can do for you?
dlga_village_elder_recruit_start:village_elder_recruit_decision|I can think of {reg5} whom I suspect would jump at the chance. If you could pay {reg13} aurums {reg7?each for their equipment:for his equipment}. Does that suit you?
dlga_village_elder_recruit_decision:village_elder_pretalk|Tell {reg7?them:him} to make ready.
dlga_village_elder_recruit_decision:village_elder_pretalk.1|No, not now.
dlga_village_elder_active_mission_1:village_elder_active_mission_2|Yes {reg33?Madam:Sir}, have you made any progress on it?
dlga_village_elder_active_mission_2:village_elder_deliver_grain_thank|Indeed. I brought you {reg5} packs of grain.
dlga_village_elder_deliver_grain_thank:village_elder_deliver_grain_thank_2|My good {reg33?Lady:Lord}. You have saved us from hunger and desperation. We cannot thank you enough, but you'll always be in our prayers. The village of {s13} will not forget what you have done for us.
dlga_village_elder_deliver_grain_thank_2:village_elder_talk|My good {reg33?Lady:Lord}, please, is there anything I can do for you?
dlga_village_elder_active_mission_2:village_elder_active_mission_3|I am still working on it.
dlga_village_elder_active_mission_2:village_elder_mission_failed|I am afraid I won't be able to finish it.
dlga_village_elder_active_mission_3:village_elder_pretalk|Thank you, {s0}. We are praying for your success everyday.
dlga_village_elder_mission_failed:village_elder_pretalk|Ah, I am sorry to hear that {s0}. I'll try to think of something else.
dlga_village_elder_request_mission_ask:village_elder_pretalk|Well {s0} you are already engaged with a task helping us. We cannot ask more from you.
dlga_village_elder_request_mission_ask:village_elder_pretalk.1|No {s0}, We don't have any other tasks for you.
dlga_village_elder_request_mission_ask:village_elder_tell_mission|A task?
dlga_village_elder_tell_mission:village_elder_tell_deliver_grain_mission|My good {reg33?Lady:Sir}, our village has been going through such hardships lately. The harvest has been bad, and recently some merciless bandits took away our seed grain that we had reserved for the planting season. If we cannot find some grain soon, we will not be able to plant our fields and then we will have nothing to eat for the coming year. If you can help us, we would be indebted to you forever.
dlga_village_elder_tell_deliver_grain_mission:village_elder_tell_deliver_grain_mission_2|Hmmm. How much grain do you need?
dlga_village_elder_tell_deliver_grain_mission:village_elder_deliver_grain_mission_reject|I can't be bothered with this. Ask help from someone else.
dlga_village_elder_tell_deliver_grain_mission_2:village_elder_tell_deliver_grain_mission_3|I think {reg5} packs of grain will let us start the planting. Hopefully, we can find charitable people to help us with the rest.
dlga_village_elder_tell_deliver_grain_mission_3:village_elder_deliver_grain_mission_accept|Then I will go and find you the grain you need.
dlga_village_elder_tell_deliver_grain_mission_3:village_elder_deliver_grain_mission_reject|I am afraid I don't have time for this. You'll need to find help elsewhere.
dlga_village_elder_deliver_grain_mission_accept:close_window|Thank you, {s0}. We'll be praying for you night and day.
dlga_village_elder_deliver_grain_mission_reject:close_window|Yes {s0}, of course. I am sorry if I have bothered you with our troubles.
dlga_village_elder_tell_mission:village_elder_tell_train_peasants_against_bandits_mission|We are suffering greatly at the hands of a group of bandits. They take our food and livestock, and kill anyone who doesn't obey them immediately. Our men are angry that we cannot defend ourselves, but we are only simple farmers... However, with some help, I think that some of the people here could be more than that. We just need an experienced warrior to teach us how to fight.
dlga_village_elder_tell_train_peasants_against_bandits_mission:village_elder_train_peasants_against_bandits_mission_accept|I can teach you how to defend yourself.
dlga_village_elder_tell_train_peasants_against_bandits_mission:village_elder_train_peasants_against_bandits_mission_reject|You peasants have no business taking up arms. Just pay the bandits and be off with it.
dlga_village_elder_train_peasants_against_bandits_mission_accept:close_window|You will? Oh, splendid! We would be deeply indebted to you, {s0}. I'll instruct the village folk to assemble here and receive your training. If you can teach us how to defend ourselves, I promise you'll receive everything we can give you in return for your efforts.
dlga_village_elder_train_peasants_against_bandits_mission_reject:close_window|Yes, of course {s0}.  Thank you for your counsel.
dlga_village_elder_tell_mission:village_elder_tell_deliver_cattle_mission|Bandits have driven away our cattle. Our pastures are empty. If we had just a few heads of cattle we could start to raise a herd again.
dlga_village_elder_tell_deliver_cattle_mission:village_elder_tell_deliver_cattle_mission_2|How many animals do you need?
dlga_village_elder_tell_deliver_cattle_mission:village_elder_deliver_cattle_mission_reject|I don't have time for this. Ask help from someone else.
dlga_village_elder_tell_deliver_cattle_mission_2:village_elder_tell_deliver_cattle_mission_3|I think {reg5} heads will suffice for a small herd.
dlga_village_elder_tell_deliver_cattle_mission_3:village_elder_deliver_cattle_mission_accept|Then I will bring you the cattle you need.
dlga_village_elder_tell_deliver_cattle_mission_3:village_elder_deliver_cattle_mission_reject|I am afraid I don't have time for this. You'll need to find help elsewhere.
dlga_village_elder_deliver_cattle_mission_accept:close_window|Thank you, {s0}. We'll be praying for you night and day.
dlga_village_elder_deliver_cattle_mission_reject:close_window|Yes {s0}, of course. I am sorry if I have bothered you with our troubles.
dlga_village_elder_tell_mission:village_elder_pretalk|Thank you, {s0}, but we do not really need anything right now.
dlga_village_elder_tell_mission:elder_quest_scholar|My {reg33?Lady:Lord}! You must help! They are eating us out of house and home! Wait, let me explain. Several days ago, a party of scholars arrived in the village. They were on their way to {s8}, when they were attacked by bandits. Their escort fled, and the scholars themselves barely made it here.
dlga_elder_quest_scholar:escort_scholars_quest_brief|And now we can't get rid of them! They refuse to leave without an escort and they're chubby fellows, my {reg33?Lady:Lord}. They eat, and eat, and eat. If we don't get rid of them soon, we'll all be in the poorhouse. If you can take them to {s8}, we will be eternally grateful. But please, don't lose them along the way, for sure as oats is oats, they'll be back here like a shot.
dlga_escort_scholars_quest_brief:scholar_quest_taken|I will escort the scholars.
dlga_escort_scholars_quest_brief:escort_scholars_reject|Sorry. I can't do that right now
dlga_scholar_quest_taken:close_window|Thank you, {reg33?madam:sir}. We'll wish you god speed.

dlga_goods_merchant_talk:trade_info_request|What goods should I buy here to trade with other towns?
dlga_goods_merchant_talk:close_window|Nothing. Thanks.
dlga_trade_info_request:trade_info_request_2|That information can be best obtained from caravan masters and travelling merchants. If you want I can send you to the district where foreign merchants stay at when they come to the town. If you spend some time there and listen to the talk, you can learn a lot about what to buy and where to sell it.
dlga_trade_info_request_2:close_window|Then I'll go and spend some time with these merchants.
dlga_trade_info_request_2:goods_merchant_pretalk|I have no time for this right now.
dlga_start:arena_intro_1.1|Good day friend. If you came to watch the tournaments you came in vain. There won't be a tournament here anytime soon.
dlga_arena_intro_1:arena_intro_2|Tournaments? So they hold the tournaments here...
dlga_arena_intro_2:arena_intro_3|Yes. You should see this place during one of the tournament fights. Everyone from the town and nearby villages comes here. The crowd becomes mad with excitement. Anyway, as I said, there won't be an event here soon, so there isn't much to see. Except, there is an official duel every now and then, and  of course we have melee fights almost every day.
dlga_arena_intro_3:arena_training_melee_intro|Tell me about the melee fights.
dlga_arena_training_melee_intro:arena_training_melee_intro_2|The fighters and knights get bored waiting for the next tournament, so they have invented the training melee. It is a simple idea really. Fighters jump into the arena with a weapon. There are no rules, no teams. Everyone beats at each other until there is only one fighter left standing. Sounds like fun, eh?
dlga_arena_training_melee_intro_2:arena_training_melee_intro_reward|Is there a reward?
dlga_arena_training_melee_intro_reward:arena_training_melee_intro_2|There is, actually. Some of the wealthy townsmen offer prizes for those fighters who show great skill in the fights. If you can beat {reg1} opponents before going down, you'll earn {reg11} aurums. You'll get {reg12} aurums for striking down at least {reg2} opponents, {reg13} aurums if you can defeat {reg3} opponents, and {reg14} aurums if you can survive long enough to beat {reg4} opponents. If you can manage to be the last {reg33?fighter:man} standing, you'll earn the great prize of the fights, {reg15} aurums. Sounds good, eh?

dlga_arena_master_fight_result:arena_master_pre_talk|Ha-ha, that's quite the bruise you're sporting. But don't worry; everybody gets trounced once in awhile. The important thing is to pick yourself up, dust yourself off and keep fighting. That's what champions do.
dlga_arena_master_fight_result:arena_master_pre_talk.1|Hey, you managed to take down {reg8} opponents. Not bad. But that won't bring you any prize money. Now, if I were you, I would go back there and show everyone what I can do...
dlga_arena_master_fight_result:arena_master_pre_talk.2|You put up quite a good fight there. Good moves. You definitely show promise. And you earned a prize of {reg10} aurums for knocking down {reg8} opponents.
dlga_arena_master_fight_result:arena_master_pre_talk.3|That was a good fight you put up there. You managed to take down no less than {reg8} opponents. And of course, you earned a prize money of {reg10} aurums.

Here in {s5}, we produce less than {reg4} towns, and produce more than {reg5}. Production is of course affected by the supply of raw materials, as well as by the overall prosperity of the town.
dlga_mayor_wealth_comparison_3:mayor_wealth_comparison_4|In terms of the output of the surrounding villages, the town of {s4} is the richest in Perisno. Here in {s5}, the villages produce less than the hinterland around {reg4} towns, and produce more than {reg5}. The wealth of a town's hinterland, of course, is heavily dependent on the tides of war. Looting and pillage, and shifts in territory, can make a major impact.
dlga_mayor_wealth_comparison_4:mayor_wealth_comparison_5|In terms of trade, the town of {s4} is believed to have received the most visits from caravans over the past few months. Here in {s5}, we are less visited than {reg4} towns, and more visited than {reg5}. 
dlga_mayor_wealth_comparison_5:mayor_pretalk|In terms of attacks on travellers, the town of {s4} is believed to be the most dangerous. Here in {s5}, we are less afflicted by bandits and raiders than {reg4} towns, and more afflicted than {reg5}.
