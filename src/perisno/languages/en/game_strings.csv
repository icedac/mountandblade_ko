str_village_alt_prosperity_0|Only a handful of people are strong enough to work in the fields, many of which are becoming overgrown with weeds.

The draft animals have long since starved or were eaten, although a few carcasses still lie on the outskirts, their bones knawed by wild beasts.
str_village_alt_prosperity_20|Some farmers and animals are out in the fields, but their small numbers suggest that some villagers may be emigrating in search of food. Farm implements look rusty and broken. Brush and weeds seem to be reclaiming some of the outermost fields.
str_village_alt_prosperity_40|The fields and orchards are busy, with villagers engaged in the tasks of the seasons. Humans and animals alike look relatively healthy and well-fed.

str_oasis_village_alt_prosperity_0|The palm groves are virtually abandoned, and the canals which irrigate them are clogged with silt. The handful of villagers you see look malnourished and restless. The draft animals have long since starved or were eaten, although a few carcasses still lie on the outskirts, their bones knawed by the wild jackals of the desert.
str_oasis_village_alt_prosperity_20|Few villagers can be seen tending to the palm groves, and in places, the desert dunes appear to be encroaching on the gardens. Many of the canals are clogged with silt, and the wells and cisterns are filled with sand.
str_oasis_village_alt_prosperity_40|Men and women are busy tending the palm groves, climbing to the tops of trees to pollinate the fruit. Healthy animals draw the pumps and wheels that bring water to the fields. Some of the irrigation canals and cisterns, however, could use some maintenance.
str_oasis_village_alt_prosperity_60|The palm groves and orchards are humming with activity. Farmers call to each other cheerfully from the tops of the trees, where they pollinate the date fruit.

str_oasis_village_alt_prosperity_80|The palm groves are humming with activity, as farmers load up a bumper crop of dates for sale to the market. Men and women are hard at work digging new wells and canals, to bring additional land under irrigation.

str_retirement_text_1|Only too late do you realise that your money won't last. It doesn't take you long to fritter away what little you bothered to save, and you fare poorly in several desperate attempts to start adventuring again. You end up a beggar in {s9}, living on alms and the charity of the church.
str_retirement_text_2|Only too late do you realise that your money won't last. It doesn't take you long to fritter away what little you bothered to save. Once every aurum has evaporated in your hands you are forced to start a life of crime in the backstreets of {s9}, using your skills to eke out a living robbing coppers from women and poor townsmen.
str_retirement_text_3|Only too late do you realise that your money won't last. It doesn't take you long to fritter away what little you bothered to save, and you end up a penniless drifter, going from tavern to tavern blagging drinks from indulgent patrons by regaling them with war stories that no one ever believes.
str_retirement_text_4|The silver you've saved doesn't last long, but you manage to put together enough to buy some land near the village of {s7}. There you become a free farmer, and you soon begin to attract potential {wives/husbands}. In time the villagers come to treat you as their local hero. You always receive a place of honour at feasts, and your exploits are told and retold in the pubs and taverns so that the children may keep a memory of you for ever and ever.
str_retirement_text_5|The silver you've saved doesn't last long, but it's enough to buy a small tavern in {s9}. Although the locals are wary of you at first, they soon accept you into their midst. In time your growing tavern becomes a popular feasthall and meeting place. People come for miles to eat or stay there due to your sheer renown and the epic stories you tell of your adventuring days.
str_retirement_text_6|You've saved wisely throughout your career, and now your silver and your intelligence allow you to make some excellent investments to cement your future. After buying several shops and warehouses in {s9}, your shrewdness turns you into one of the most prominent merchants in town, and you soon become a wealthy {man/woman} known as much for your trading empire as your exploits in battle.
str_retirement_text_7|As a landed noble, however minor, your future is all but assured. You settle in your holdfast at {s7}, administrating the village and fields, adjudicating the local courts and fulfilling your obligations to your liege lord. Occasionally your liege calls you to muster and command in his campaigns, but these stints are brief, and you never truly return to the adventuring of your younger days. You have already made your fortune. With your own hall and holdings, you've few wants that your personal wealth and the income of your lands cannot afford you.
str_retirement_text_8|There is no question that you've done very well for yourself. Your extensive holdings and adventuring wealth are enough to guarantee you a rich and easy life for the rest of your days. Retiring to your noble seat in {s8}, you exchange adventure for politics, and you soon establish yourself as a considerable power in your liege lord's kingdom. With intrigue to busy yourself with, your own forests to hunt, a hall to feast in and a hundred fine war stories to tell, you have little trouble making the best of the years that follow.
str_retirement_text_9|As a reward for your competent and loyal service, your liege lord decrees that you be given a hereditary title, joining the major nobility of the realm. Soon you complete your investitute as baron of {s7}, and you become one of your liege's close advisors and adjutants. Your renown garners you much subtle pull and influence as well as overt political power. Now you spend your days playing the games of power, administering your great fiefs, and recounting the old times of adventure and glory.
str_retirement_text_10|Though you started from humble beginnings, your liege lord holds you in high esteem, and a ripple of shock passes through the realm when he names you to the hereditary title of {count/countess} of {s9}.

str_npc1_intro|Psst! You want to know something?
str_npc2_intro|You! Boy! You hire mercenary!?
str_npc3_intro|Hello there. Do you happen to be a mercenary captain?
str_npc4_intro|Greetings. I am Tylen, and I come from the noble family Tylenia of Tolrania.
str_npc5_intro|Greetings.
str_npc6_intro|The Old Gods talk to me. I am their preacher, their messenger...
str_npc7_intro|Keep your distance! I don't want some rogue near me!
str_npc8_intro|What do you want?
str_npc9_intro|You there, good {man/woman}, be so kind as to fetch me another drink, eh?
str_npc10_intro|Greetings. I am Fazl, a merchant from the deserts of Drahara.
str_npc11_intro|Hey you, how are you? Care to chat for a little while?
str_npc12_intro|Hello, my friend. Care to join me for a drink?
str_npc13_intro|We are cowards to have run... This shame... I cannot live with it...
str_npc14_intro|Yes? What is it?
str_npc15_intro|You there, I've heard of you. They call you a leader of men. Is that true?
str_npc16_intro|Hello. From your look, I can tell you are a leader. A mercenary, perhaps? What is it you want?
str_npc17_intro|Hello, traveller. Is there something I can help you with?
str_npc1_intro_response_1|What?
str_npc2_intro_response_1|Yes, I do hire mercenaries. Who are you?
str_npc3_intro_response_1|Hello. What would someone like you be doing here?
str_npc4_intro_response_1|Er… I've never heard of you, I'm sorry.
str_npc5_intro_response_1|Hello. Who are you?
str_npc6_intro_response_1|What are you talking about?
str_npc7_intro_response_1|I'm sorry. It's just...what is someone of such obvious noble standard doing here?
str_npc8_intro_response_1|Merely to pass the time of day, ma'am, if you're not otherwise engaged.
str_npc9_intro_response_1|Sorry sir, but I'm not your tavernkeeper and less even a servant.
str_npc10_intro_response_1|From Drahara? That's a dusty place.
str_npc11_intro_response_1|Hmm, What is an Elven Women like you doing here?
str_npc12_intro_response_1|Of course. What is it you want to discuss?
str_npc13_intro_response_1|Men can change their fortunes. We can change ours.
str_npc14_intro_response_1|To pass the time of day with a fellow traveller, if you permit.
str_npc15_intro_response_1|I am. What concern is it of yours, if I may ask?
str_npc16_intro_response_1|I could be. I want to sit here and have a drink with you, that's all.
str_npc17_intro_response_1|Greetings. Who are you?
str_npc1_intro_response_2|Get out of my sight, you criminal!.
str_npc2_intro_response_2|Go and learn common speech. I don't want to listen to your disgusting Volheere accent.
str_npc3_intro_response_2|Run along now, girl. I have work to do.
str_npc4_intro_response_2|Never heard of you. You must be low nobility. Goodbye.
str_npc5_intro_response_2|Goodbye.
str_npc6_intro_response_2|Foolish Priest, I'll have none of that nonsense. Have a bad day.
str_npc7_intro_response_2|Right. I'll not bother you, then.
str_npc8_intro_response_2|Nothing at all, from one so clearly disinclined to pleasantries. Good day to you.
str_npc9_intro_response_2|Fetch it yourself!
str_npc10_intro_response_2|Goodbye. Don't try to haggle with me.
str_npc11_intro_response_2|Oh well, I wish we could get to know each other.
str_npc12_intro_response_2|Sorry, I am afraid that I am otherwise engaged right now.
str_npc13_intro_response_2|[leave him to his thoughts]
str_npc14_intro_response_2|Nothing at all. My apologies.
str_npc15_intro_response_2|I'd be obliged if you minded your own business, sir.
str_npc16_intro_response_2|Mind your own business, girl.
str_npc17_intro_response_2|Goodbye, stranger.
str_npc1_backstory_a|It is a long story. I suggest you sit down and buy a drink for us two while I talk.
str_npc2_backstory_a| is Volheere Jarl! I seeking for adventure! Me is Uldin! Jordynson! I am noble!
str_npc3_backstory_a|Let me tell you.
str_npc4_backstory_a|Really? Well, it is not very surprising because I have long forsaken that name. I go as Tylen now, only Tylen. Sit, and I will tell you my story.
str_npc5_backstory_a|I am Aracanus.
str_npc6_backstory_a|The Old Gods are talking to me. They have proclaimed me to be their messenger to the world. Want to hear my story?
str_npc7_backstory_a|A good question and I shall tell you.
str_npc8_backstory_a|Okay. I will tell you my story, if you want.
str_npc9_backstory_a|Ah … I am sorry. I am unfamiliar to the customs of you easterners. I am from Maccavia. Would you like to hear my story?
str_npc10_backstory_a|Indeed, I have traveled far.
str_npc11_backstory_a|I can tell you about myself If you wish.
str_npc12_backstory_a|I shall tell you my story.
str_npc13_backstory_a|Fuck...
str_npc14_backstory_a|Very well. I do not mind. My name is Deitrich, from the Reich.
str_npc15_backstory_a|I must warn you of a great danger to the land.
str_npc16_backstory_a|Well, {sir/madame}, I am the youngest child of five, born in a Elintoran ancient noble family.
str_npc17_backstory_a|My name is Kengesh, I am a son of the great Kuulan.
str_npc1_backstory_b|I was an Imperial Spy working for the Klyrintin Empire. However, they thought I was unworthy and called me a traitor, and then exiled me out of the country. Now, Kylrint is planning an invasion against perisno, but who knows when they will strike.
str_npc2_backstory_b|(mumbles thickly in his own language)
str_npc3_backstory_b|My name is Zaira, and I am from the Swiftrider tribe in Drahara. I decided that a tribal life as nomads was not the life I have grown up to live, so I decided to say goodbye to my family and friends and explore the world outside the deserts. It has been a wonderful experience so far.
str_npc4_backstory_b|I used to be a noble, but I have fallen from grace since then. I have decided to start my own band of rogue knights to fight against the Tolranian King, who's Tyranny goes unopposed.
str_npc5_backstory_b|You have never heard of me. I am a traveler, a wanderer. I am from the Ancient Times, when Perisno was inhabited by the Gods. Those times are long gone, and now I wander, looking for secrets ... secrets ... looking for many secrets.
str_npc6_backstory_b|One day, when I was sleeping, I had a dream. I was not just a dream- it was like the truth! It was so vivid, I can still remember every detail, all the colors, the voices, and everything. It was like I was awake in a dream. Do not think me mad; hear what I have to say next.
str_npc7_backstory_b|I am the daughter of a very influential duke of Tolrania, whom I will not care to name for you will most surely recognize him and possibly give me to him. I was supposed to marry another man from another high noble family, but I did not want to.
str_npc8_backstory_b|I am the disowned daughter of a Hakkonese nobleman. He disowned me because he thought I was too smart - in the Hakkonese society, you understand, women cannot be like men. They are seen as inferiors and servants to men. I knew how to hunt and kill like any other man, and he punished me for it. He threw me away and told me to never return.
str_npc9_backstory_b|I used to be a Maccavian noble and the most vigorous supporter of the New Gods cause. The King, Agathor Rex, cast me out and disbanded my entire army because of my status. He feared I would become powerful enough to take his throne, which was very possible. Only a twist of fate made me lose it.
str_npc10_backstory_b|I am from Drahara, as I've said, and I have come to these lands to trade. The journey here has not been gentle to me, as the moment we set out from the capital, we were beset by Desert Vultures who quickly took me prisoner. I managed to escape, and was halfway to my destination when some Tolranian Outlaws took me prisoner again and demanded me to hand over all my goods - every single one of them.
str_npc11_backstory_b|I am an Elven Noble, and I can wield the sword better than anyone, while my bow can sing with the winds. Not to mention I can be more then a simple asset to you and your party.
str_npc12_backstory_b|I used to be this land's foremost and best physician. I have healed and tended to four Draharan Emirs, three Hakkonese lords, one Tolranian Duke, and even the Reich Prince himself. Those were my glory days. I made tons of aurum, and people from all nations begged me to heal them. Most of my earnings I gave to the poor of course. You have the look of someone who could benefit from my experience...
str_npc13_backstory_b|I just want to have some bloody honor again. We live as cowards now... When we could have died as true men of Hylr.
str_npc14_backstory_b|I will not tell you a lot about myself. I will keep the story short, unlike other people at taverns, who just love to gossip and blab their information as if they have no privacy at all . Such behavior is disgraceful in the Reich. I am a noble lord, and I am what could be called a pioneer of my nation.
str_npc15_backstory_b|I was sent over the sea from my home continent Nadire to warn the Persinen Kingdoms about the threat posed by the bastard heretic Zann. Our God emperor, Shang Jin, had a bastard child. Rightfully believing it would take away from his everlasting glory he had the child taken far away and disowned.  Twenty-Five cycles later has him launching a campain against his father. Ten cycles later has him fighting a losing war against his Royal Majesties Imperial Army. By this time it is believed that Zann's spies had informed him about the existence of Perisno. He is sending an invasion into Perisno with the intent of retreating from his majesties armies while at the same time conquering Perisno. I was sent here in our fastest boat to warn the Perisnoan kingdoms about the threat posed by posed the Zann Dynasty.
str_npc16_backstory_b|I grew up in the forests of Elintor, as you can see. I have always longed to see the outside world, to serve as a soldier. I got this opportunity one day when we declared war against Tolrania. After fighting in a few battles, I quit being a soldier and went back to the family mansion to train soldiers.
str_npc17_backstory_b|I and my brothers travelled to Perisno 28 years ago from a continent very far from here.  Initially our father was in charge, but he was killed in a battle when our ships were attacked by Hakkon fleet. After that happened, my older brothers swore to avenge his death. When we finally arrived to Perisno, they founded the town of Tumatarhun that became the start of our kingdom.
str_npc1_backstory_c|I would like to join a group that is trustworthy and will not betray me like my Empire did. I am abandoned now, with little money in my pocket and almost nothing left. Can you be such a group?
str_npc2_backstory_c|I want join mercenary!
str_npc3_backstory_c|Now, I am looking to join someone and share my adventures with them.
str_npc4_backstory_c|I want to continue fighting against the king, perhaps following one who will be strong enough. Can you be such a one?
str_npc5_backstory_c|I have grown lost in my search. I need one to help me find my way again.
str_npc6_backstory_c|The Gods have chosen me for their messenger to the world. I would like to start somewhere, and join a mercenary company to preach to them. You cannot refuse, lest you wish to invoke the wrath of the Old Gods.
str_npc7_backstory_c|So I ran away, and here I am, with nothing. I look for someone to hire me so I can join them and see the world.
str_npc8_backstory_c|When I have enough gold to raise an army I shall go back and take what it is mine.
str_npc9_backstory_c|Now, I have nothing. I wish to offer my sword to someone worthy like you. Will you let me join you?
str_npc10_backstory_c|I am now looking for a mercenary company to protect me. I have lost my life's savings.
str_npc11_backstory_c|I am quite young as you can see, and my pretty features hold a lot of secrets. Will you give me a chance?
str_npc12_backstory_c|I may be old now, but far from useless. I can treat your men when they are wounded and treat you as well.
str_npc13_backstory_c|We live as cowards now... When we could have died as true men of Hylr. I don't want to live this life in shame.
str_npc14_backstory_c|So now I look for a mercenary company to join and show my skills to, in the name of the Reich.
str_npc15_backstory_c|You will not regret taking me into battle. I am one of the emperors black warriors and nephew to his glory. A hundred men have died before my nadachi and hundreds more of the bastards men will.
str_npc16_backstory_c|As the youngest child, I have less responsibility and more freedom than my siblings. I wish to see the world, and I need a suitable mercenary escort. Can you recruit me?
str_npc17_backstory_c|We have always been close, but not so long ago we had an argument, for I disagree that we should continue this war against Hakkon. So, unable to persuade my brothers, I just left and have been travelling these lands since that day.
str_npc1_backstory_later|I am down to my last fifteen aurums. I need work now. I am a useful servant.
str_npc2_backstory_later|I need be hired!
str_npc3_backstory_later|I have continued to look for work and adventure on my own, although it will not be long before some bandit catches me and kills me. I need work soon.
str_npc4_backstory_later|I have been hiding from the Tolranian King's soldiers, but it has not been easy. I need someone to recruit me.
str_npc5_backstory_later|I am looking for the secrets ... the secrets of the universe.
str_npc6_backstory_later|I have continued preaching to unworthy souls. I think you are worthy, however.
str_npc7_backstory_later|I have been wandering around, looking for work. Please, let me go with you.
str_npc8_backstory_later|I need to find a leader that I can trust and will not throw me away like my father did. I think you are that such leader.
str_npc9_backstory_later|I still labor for work. I need someone to take me to fight.
str_npc10_backstory_later|I have been trying to make what money I can, but it is hard in this foreign land. I will need someone to show me the way.
str_npc11_backstory_later|I am running low of coin, and I wish to explore a lot more, if only I found the right party to join. You see I will not join just anyone. An Elven Women such as myself needs to be respected for I can be both delicate and deadly.
str_npc12_backstory_later|I have been here and about, tending to the sick and taking what reward I can. But the people of these parts are ignorant, and have little respect for my craft. The few aurums I make are barely enough for me to replenish my stock of medicine. I should be grateful for the chance to find other work.
str_npc13_backstory_later|(If you see this dialog, it is a bug)
str_npc14_backstory_later|I look for a mercenary company to join and show my skills to, in the name of the Reich.
str_npc15_backstory_later|I have been to many new places, and seen many wonders. I have not, however, seen a worthy leader of my sword other than you.
str_npc16_backstory_later|I have been travelling all of the kingdoms of Perisno looking for a finer champion, but there is not one in all the land.
str_npc17_backstory_later|I have been travelling these lands, like before. There are so many beautiful places here!
str_npc1_backstory_response_1|I can be. Your skills may prove useful to me.
str_npc2_backstory_response_1|We'll need a strong Volheere like you in our party. You may join.
str_npc3_backstory_response_1|You could join us.
str_npc4_backstory_response_1|I can be. An extra hand won't hurt.
str_npc5_backstory_response_1|I might be able to offer you something.
str_npc6_backstory_response_1|Join us. You can preach to my men and make their morale high.
str_npc7_backstory_response_1|Hmm... Are you by any chance looking for work?
str_npc8_backstory_response_1|We can speed up the process for you.
str_npc9_backstory_response_1|Perhaps you would like to join my company for a while.
str_npc10_backstory_response_1|Your skills will be useful. You my join us.
str_npc11_backstory_response_1|What will you do now?
str_npc12_backstory_response_1|We will need a healer, but you need to be able to fight as well.
str_npc13_backstory_response_1|We can redeem outselves. Let us find and defeat Aethling Svafar, to avenge Torsson's death and reclaim our honor.
str_npc14_backstory_response_1|I run such a company. You may join us.
str_npc15_backstory_response_1|Bastard heretic, Hmm.
str_npc16_backstory_response_1|I can. Your skills will be valuable.
str_npc17_backstory_response_1|Would you like to join me in my travels?
str_npc1_backstory_response_2|A spy in our camp? No. Good day to you.
str_npc2_backstory_response_2|No, you will scare my men.
str_npc3_backstory_response_2|Go back to your tribe. You will find more use there.
str_npc4_backstory_response_2|Goodbye.
str_npc5_backstory_response_2|You are crazy, I think. Goodbye.
str_npc6_backstory_response_2|You are a fraud and a liar, I think. Go trick someone else.
str_npc7_backstory_response_2|No thanks. Go back to your family.
str_npc8_backstory_response_2|You won't find any help from me.
str_npc9_backstory_response_2|No, I don't think so. Good day.
str_npc10_backstory_response_2|Well, that's life, friend. Goodbye and get over it.
str_npc11_backstory_response_2|Very interesting, but I have work to do.
str_npc12_backstory_response_2|Sorry. I can't take on any new hands.
str_npc13_backstory_response_2|I suppose we must repent.
str_npc14_backstory_response_2|No thanks.
str_npc15_backstory_response_2|You fool, you're speaking nonsense. Begone.
str_npc16_backstory_response_2|You will be trouble for my men. No thanks.
str_npc17_backstory_response_2|I see. Well, then I will bother you no longer.
str_npc1_signup|{reg33?Madame:Sir} -- I will be your eyes and ears, and your most loyal spy.
str_npc2_signup|(grunts in Volheerian)
str_npc3_signup|I would be pleased to join you.
str_npc4_signup|Good! I look forward to vanquishing your enemies.
str_npc5_signup|Thank you for your offer.
str_npc6_signup|Yes! I have been sent by the divine to preach to your men! I am sure of it!
str_npc7_signup|I might be. I could certainly use the money.
str_npc8_signup|I shall accept your offer.
str_npc9_signup|I would very much like that, {reg33?madame:sir}
str_npc10_signup|Great! I will begin making money again, hopefully. I will split some with you!
str_npc11_signup|I am an Elven Noble. Though I went away from my homeland to seek the outside world, I wish to join a your party if you would have me.
str_npc12_signup|I am a surgeon, not some silk-robed university physician who has never touched a body. I can get my hands dirty.
str_npc13_signup|Let us try, then.
str_npc14_signup|I would be pleased to fight alongside you, for the Reich!
str_npc15_signup|I am one of the emperors black warriors and nephew to his glory. A hundred men have died before my nadachi and hundreds more of the bastards men will.
str_npc16_signup|Thank you for your offer. I accept.
str_npc17_signup|Well, why not. I've actually started feeling lonely lately, so I wouldn't mind a company.
str_npc1_signup_2|I have spied for the Emperor himself! I know all sorts of secrets and skills. What do you say?
str_npc2_signup_2|(grunts)
str_npc3_signup_2|I will be a very nice addition to your ranks, I think. I have many skills. I grew up in a Draharan tribe, after all.
str_npc4_signup_2|Note however that as a gentleman and coming from a noble family, I expect to be in a position of command, and not be treated as one of the common soldiers.
str_npc5_signup_2|I still look for the secrets. A safe company is welcome.
str_npc6_signup_2|I shall preach my sermons to your men. May we all be blessed!
str_npc7_signup_2|I can do many things for you when I am in your company. I am not like other noblewoman of my rank, you know.
str_npc8_signup_2|I will be honored to fight with you. Just don't except me to be the one doing all the killing.
str_npc9_signup_2|I am a gentleman, and prefer to fight with sword and lance. I recognize that you are of lower birth than I, there is no shame for me to serve under an experienced captain -- presuming, of course, that your followers do not become too familiar with me. I assume that will not be a problem?
str_npc10_signup_2|You will not regret taking me. You won't regret it one bit. In no time, I shall have started a new trading empire, and let it be known that it was you who sponsored the great Fazl!.
str_npc11_signup_2|You are very wise to take me, for I am deadly with both the blade and bow. I will follow you wherever you go, and my bow will sing with your sword.
str_npc12_signup_2|I have treated every variety of wound that can be inflicted by the hand of man. Before I was a surgeon, I was a student, so you may be sure that I have inflicted wounds as well as healed them.
str_npc13_signup_2|I do not wish to talk with anyone here, let us be off as soon as you are ready.
str_npc14_signup_2|I am one of the best in Reich, and that means the best of the best. I can take care of myself fine.
str_npc15_signup_2|I was also in charge of the lesser men in battle and as such I am a skilled tactician.
str_npc16_signup_2|I can work wonders with my bow, and I have many other skills, including training. Yes, I will have your men trained up in no time.
str_npc17_signup_2|I'm not as strong as my brothers, but I'm still a fine warrior and a scout, so I won't be a burden.
str_npc1_signup_response_1|Good. You can be useful to us.
str_npc2_signup_response_1|That will do.
str_npc3_signup_response_1|Um, that's a start. We can teach you the rest.
str_npc4_signup_response_1|Very well. I'll be glad to have you with us, um, 'Baron.'
str_npc5_signup_response_1|I will be glad to have you with us.
str_npc6_signup_response_1|Happy to be of service! Get your things together, and we shall be on our way.
str_npc7_signup_response_1|I will hire you. Try not to shoot anyone on your first day.
str_npc8_signup_response_1|No fear, ma'am. You're the widow and the daughter of a thane, and you'll be treated as such.
str_npc9_signup_response_1|Well, it shouldn't be. I'll have a talk with them.
str_npc10_signup_response_1|Good man. We'll treat you with the respect you deserve.
str_npc11_signup_response_1|It sounds like you'll be very useful. Please, come!
str_npc12_signup_response_1|Then welcome to our company, doctor
str_npc13_signup_response_1|I will do what I need to do, talk to Chief Falmann on what happened, then we will be off.
str_npc14_signup_response_1|Good. I'll be happy to hire someone like you.
str_npc15_signup_response_1|I will champion your cause. But no one will be dying in battle.
str_npc16_signup_response_1|It sounds like you can do the job. I will hire you.
str_npc17_signup_response_1|That's great, then I will gladly welcome you to my party.
str_npc1_signup_response_2|I'd prefer not to take the risk. Good day, sir.
str_npc2_signup_response_2|Good day to you.
str_npc3_signup_response_2|Actually, we were looking for a slightly different skill-set.
str_npc4_signup_response_2|Good day, sir.
str_npc5_signup_response_2|I prefer to keep sane company.
str_npc6_signup_response_2|On second thought, maybe a mercenary company is not what you need right now.
str_npc7_signup_response_2|Actually, on second thought, you sound like you might be trouble. Good day to you. 
str_npc8_signup_response_2|I've changed my mind. Goodbye.
str_npc9_signup_response_2|You assume wrong, sir. In my company we respect courage and skill, rather than noble birth.
str_npc10_signup_response_2|On second thought, we need fighters, not merchants. Good day.
str_npc11_signup_response_2|Sorry, my dear. We've already got as many in our company as we can handle. But i do wish we could take you.
str_npc12_signup_response_2|A battle is not the same thing as a tavern brawl. Perhaps you should look elsewhere for work.
str_npc13_signup_response_2|To bring honor to myself I must rid myself of the dishonorable. Goodbye, and good luck on your own.
str_npc14_signup_response_2|Good day, sir. I don't want a mysterious Reichian like you.
str_npc15_signup_response_2|I don't need an spy in my group. But you did warn me about the invasion and for that I will spare your life.
str_npc16_signup_response_2|No thanks. The thought of a woman training my men is awkward.
str_npc17_signup_response_2|On second thought, I don't think I need a scout or a warrior of your skill.
str_npc1_payment|I will be very useful to you, {reg33?madame:sir}, you can bet on that. Just one more thing before we leave, would you mind lending me {reg3} aurums? I am ashamed to say it, but I have made myself a bit of debt here, staying in this tavern over the last few weeks and the tavern owners no longer believe that I am loaded with gold as I used to tell them. You know, things could get ugly here if they see me leaving with you before paying them.
str_npc2_payment|I need money. Give me {reg3} aurums.
str_npc3_payment|Now please show me a symbol of your loyalty as leader before I will offer you mine as soldier.({reg3} aurums required).
str_npc4_payment|Excellent. I will need {reg3} aurums though. Sorry for the trouble.
str_npc5_payment|My services are not cheap. Give me {reg3} aurums. I need money to continue my research.
str_npc6_payment|Great. But before we go I have to perform a ritual to the Old Gods. This ritual will cost some money. Give me {reg3} aurums and it shall be done.
str_npc7_payment|All right then. I will come with you. But I want a payment of {reg3} aurums first. You aren't expecting me to work for free, do you?
str_npc8_payment|Then I will fight your enemies for you. But first I want a bounty of {reg3} aurums. If you are a worthy captain who can lead {his/her} company to riches and plunder, you should have no trouble paying. I cannot afford to follow a pauper.
str_npc9_payment|That's very good of you. And before I join, can you lend me {reg3} aurums, so that I can buy some proper clothing that befits a gentleman of noble birth such as myself. The coat on me has been worn down badly due to my recent bad fortune, and I cannot let common soldiers mistake me as one of their own.
str_npc10_payment|Good. I will need an initial sum of money to get my business started up. Can you lend me {reg3} aurums? I promise you by the time we get through I will have quadrupled the hundred times of that sum.
str_npc11_payment|Hmm, I would love to join your party, but you see before I can do so I must ask for a... small fee of {reg3} aurums. Ever since leaving my woodlands I have not done too great for myself. It seems some people don't wish to engage with a elven noble such as myself.
str_npc12_payment|I will gladly join you, but I will need a small amount of money to buy medicine. Could you lend me {reg3} aurums?
str_npc14_payment|The services of the Reich do not come cheap. Show me you are not just some random mercenary company by paying me {reg3} aurums.
str_npc15_payment|To make a few preparations before our journey, I'd have to ask you for {reg3} aurums to reequip myself.
str_npc16_payment|Now, that's good news, captain. So, how about paying me a little something to seal off our agreement? A mere {reg3} would be enough. Please don't take this the wrong way, but I've had some bad luck with employers in the past.
str_npc17_payment|Good. Except, well, if I join your party under your command, then I would like {reg3} aurums as a payment for my service. I need this money for certain personal matters anyway.
str_npc1_payment_response|Why do I feel like I might regret this? Here's {reg3} aurums. Now, fall in with the rest.
str_npc2_payment_response|Of course, my friend. There are many different tongues spoken within our ranks...
str_npc3_payment_response|Here's {reg3} aurums. I hope you will have trust in me as a leader.
str_npc4_payment_response|Certainly. Here's {reg3} aurums...Tylen.
str_npc5_payment_response|Well... here's {reg3} aurums, then. That is a lot of money, but we can always try to get you some lead for your experiments, maybe you'll figure out how to make it into gold...
str_npc6_payment_response|Okay then. I don't want to insult the Old Gods... Here's {reg3} aurums.
str_npc7_payment_response|No, of course not. Here's {reg3} aurums.
str_npc8_payment_response|Oh, I am no pauper, madame. At least not until I met you. Here's {reg3} aurums for you.
str_npc9_payment_response|Very well, here's {reg3} aurums. You are sure you need as much? - hmm
str_npc10_payment_response|Of course. Here, {reg3} aurums. That would buy you a lot of beer. Not that you should have more!
str_npc11_payment_response|Very well, here's {reg3} aurums. Make yourself ready. We leave soon, if we do not have to sell our horses first, after this.
str_npc12_payment_response|I can lend you {reg3} aurums, no problem. Welcome to out company! You can pay that back anytime...just mentioning
str_npc14_payment_response|I am no ordinary company. That sum is nothing. And I am only sweating because of this incredible heat inside this tavern. Here is {reg3} aurums. You are most exp...welcome in our company.
str_npc15_payment_response|{reg3} aurums, here you are...that buys you a lot of equipment!
str_npc16_payment_response|All right, here's {reg3} aurums for you. Are you sure you don't need more...forget please that I asked that, oh noble Elven Lady!
str_npc17_payment_response|All right, here is your money. I will be waiting for you outside the town.
str_npc1_morality_speech|Sorry, captain. Please don't take this the wrong way, but it's a hard life and it's a bit much that we {s21}. Take a little more care in the future, captain, if you don't mind my saying.
str_npc2_morality_speech|I hope you don't mind my saying so, but it's a bit hard for me to see us {s21}. Maybe I ought to try to be more of a hardened soldier, but if we could try to exercise a little mercy from time to time, I'd sleep better.
str_npc3_morality_speech|Perhaps it is not my place to say so, {reg33?madame:sir}, but I confess that I am somewhat shocked that we {s21}. Of course I realize that war is cruel, but there is no need to make it more cruel than necessary.
str_npc4_morality_speech|Your pardon -- just so you know, the men of the House of Rolf do not care to {s21}. I will not be pleased if you continue to take this course.
str_npc5_morality_speech|It is not good to {s21}. 
str_npc6_morality_speech|Excuse me, {reg33?madame:sir}. As you know, I joined with you to right wrongs, protect the innocent, and make amends for my sin. I did not expect to {s21}.
str_npc7_morality_speech|Captain -- I do not like to see us {s21}. Such are the actions of a common bandit chief, with no regard for his followers.
str_npc8_morality_speech|I was not pleased that you decided to {s21}. To fall in battle is an honour, but to fight in a warband led by a coward is a disgrace.
str_npc9_morality_speech|{reg33?Madame:Sir} -- it is not my way to {s21}. Men of my house will accept death but not dishonour. Please do not make me ashamed to serve under you.
str_npc10_morality_speech|Begging your pardon, captain. I can't say that I'm happy to see us {s21}. Those are just simple people, trying to make a living. If we could try to go easy on the poor wretches, captain, I'd feel much better.
str_npc11_morality_speech|Excuse me, captain. It's not good that we {s21}. I've followed armies and warbands for 10 years, and the least the soldiers expect of a leader is to feed them, pay them, and do {reg33?her:his} best to keep their sorry skins intact as best {he/she} can.
str_npc12_morality_speech|Captain -- I do not like to see us {s21}. I am prepared to be a warrior, but not a brigand. Pray let us try to show a little more compassion.
str_npc13_morality_speech|Captain. I don't like to {s21}.
str_npc14_morality_speech|I do not care to {s21}. No one with a reputation for cowardice will be properly feared by his men.
str_npc15_morality_speech|Just because they are ruled over by our enemies doesn't give us the right to {s21} them. They are people just like we are
str_npc16_morality_speech|Captain. I don't like to {s21}.
str_npc17_morality_speech|(Kengesh doesn't complain, you shouldn't see this line)
str_npc1_2ary_morality_speech|Captain -- just so you know, I've got no problem if we {s21}. Living to fight another day makes good sense to me.
str_npc2_2ary_morality_speech|{reg33?Madame:Sir} -- I'm not altogether happy that we {s21}.
str_npc3_2ary_morality_speech|{reg33?Madame:Sir} -- I think it was a brave decision you took to {s21}. There is no shame in finding a way to avoid the spilling of blood.
str_npc4_2ary_morality_speech|Your pardon -- whatever anyone else says, I think nothing of it that you {s21}. You should adopt whatever ruse you need to survive in these troubled times.
str_npc6_2ary_morality_speech|{reg33?Madame:Sir} -- you may choose to {s21}, but would prefer to have no part in it. Such is not the path to my redemption.
str_npc9_2ary_morality_speech|Captain, I am dismayed that you {s21}. A gentle{reg33?woman:man} such as yourself should exhibit the highest standards of honour at all times.
str_npc10_2ary_morality_speech|{reg33?Sister:Brother} -- I can't say I like to see us {s21}. You should treat your men well, and they'll repay with interest.
str_npc14_2ary_morality_speech|Captain -- you should not let it bother you that you {s21}. Armies are made to do their leaders' bidding, and hardships are part of a soldier's life.
str_npc16_2ary_morality_speech|Captain -- just so you know, it's no problem by me that we {s21}. We do what we need to do to live, and they'd do the same to us if they were in our shoes.
str_npc17_2ary_morality_speech|(Kengesh doesn't complain, you shouldn't see this line)
str_npc1_personalityclash_speech|Captain -- no offense, but I'm a bit tired of {s11}. Just because he is from the Zann Dynasty does not mean he is a better man than I am. I hope he will change his foolish behavior.
str_npc2_personalityclash_speech|I dislike foolish preacher.
str_npc3_personalityclash_speech|Captain, I really don't like {s11}. He speaks nothing but of selling his goods and some other merchant nonsense. He brings shame to Draharans.
str_npc4_personalityclash_speech|{reg33?Madame:Sir}. I am from a noble family, and I will not be treated like trash, the way {s11} treats me. He is a fool, coming from a minor nobility. He should hang himself and rid the world of his foolish mind.
str_npc5_personalityclash_speech|{s11} questions me. I will not answer.
str_npc6_personalityclash_speech|Your pardon, {reg33?madame:sir}, but I cannot keep my tongue stilled any longer. That vile defiler, {s11} -- does not respect my faith! He is an infidel, a stupid outsider from a place with infidels who have no custom. Uncivilized brutes. I hope that the Old Gods will curse him, like I do.
str_npc7_personalityclash_speech|Just so you know, this insolent woman, {s11}, thinks that she is better than everyone else because of her prowess. This is despicable, and I will not tolerate her any longer. It's no wonder she was disowned.
str_npc8_personalityclash_speech|This filthy girl {s11} keeps questioning my prowess. I have beaten her in archery competitions many times already, and yet she still does not believe! She would not survive one moment under my training, when I was a leader of a small band.
str_npc9_personalityclash_speech|Sir -- {s11} is a fool. He thinks that I am lower than him in nobility, but he knows nothing of Maccavian politics! I suppose that is because a Tolranian like him doesn't know how to study, like we do. I am much higher ranked than him!
str_npc10_personalityclash_speech|I'm sorry to be a bother, captain, but that man, {s11}, seems to have a problem that I am a merchant.
str_npc11_personalityclash_speech|My lord, that woman {s11} is an uncivilized tribal woman. Why is she in this company?
str_npc12_personalityclash_speech|My lord, that lady, {s11}, seems to think she is special because of her status and she wants special treatment. After she acquired her last battle wound, we were in the healing tent, and I offered to heal her, but she said she wouldn't let a man of my standard treat her.
str_npc13_personalityclash_speech|Captain, I weary of {s11}. He annoys me all the time.
str_npc14_personalityclash_speech|Captain, I am  disgusted by that healer {s11}. He has no skills. The Reich doctors have treated me much better than he, who thinks I am a common brat.
str_npc15_personalityclash_speech|The foolish priest calls me uncivilized and says I am a brute. Well, I would be happy to tell him that my culture is much more civilized than him. Only honor has prevented me from saying so, even to one as low as him. I do hope he will change his views.
str_npc16_personalityclash_speech|Captain, I do not like that silly girl {s11}. She seems to think herself so special and strong. I could beat her in an archery competition any day. We even had one before, and when I won she accused me of cheating. I do not like being in the company of such fools.
str_npc17_personalityclash_speech|(Kengesh doesn't complain, you shouldn't see this line)
str_npc1_personalityclash_speech_b|He should really stop his foolish actions.

str_npc1_personalityclash2_speech|Captain, I don't like how {s11} fights. He is like a savage! He claws at his enemies, tears at them, and kicks them. None of what is like how civilized men fight.
str_npc2_personalityclash2_speech|I no like {s11}. He fight like girl.
str_npc3_personalityclash2_speech|I do not like {s11}. That Elven girl seems to think she is better than me.
str_npc4_personalityclash2_speech|That elven girl {s11} should be more respectful to me. I saved her life, and all she does is glare at me as if I, Tylen, was some garbage.
str_npc5_personalityclash2_speech|I do not like how {s11} fights.
str_npc6_personalityclash2_speech|My lord. Did you see {s11} during that last battle? He taunts the fallen foe as they lay stricken and helpless on the battlefield, mocking their parentage, their foolishness for having fought us.

str_npc1_personalitymatch_speech|{reg33?Madame:Sir}, did you see {s11} in that last battle? He is so valiant, so brave, so powerful, though he sometimes speaks in his own language.
str_npc2_personalitymatch_speech|{reg33?My Lady:Sir}, me want say {s11} did very good in that last battle. He fight like a bear. He kills more man than me.
str_npc3_personalitymatch_speech|Captain, I would like to say that {s11} fought bravely in that last battle.  He did extremely well for a diplomat.
str_npc4_personalitymatch_speech|I tell you, my good captain, while I was gathering the loot with {s11} in that last battle, I got her to tell me her story.
str_npc5_personalitymatch_speech|Sir, did you see {s11} in the last battle? Her arrows fly straight to the hearts of our foes, and she dances through the enemy as she cuts them down with ease.
str_npc6_personalitymatch_speech|Sir, I would like to tell you that {s11} is the best doctor we have here.  The last time I was badly injured, he had me back on my feet in 3 days. And the pain was gone.
str_npc7_personalitymatch_speech|{reg33?Miss:Sir}, I think that {s11} is every bit as good at training as she is at fighting. She's shown me a few new techniques with my weapons.
str_npc8_personalitymatch_speech|{reg33?My Lady:Sir}, {s11} hit the enemy like a berserker.  He sliced through the enemy formation like he was cutting silk.
str_npc9_personalitymatch_speech|{reg33?My Lady:Sir}, {s11} did very well in that last battle.  His reputation isn't mere talk. He saved my life out there.
str_npc10_personalitymatch_speech|I like {s11}'s attitude. He's not like other nobles who do nothing but boast about how great they are.
str_npc11_personalitymatch_speech|You know, {reg33?my Lady:Sir}, {s11} showed a move in the last battle that I've never seen before.  He said it was an ancient style that nobody teaches these days.
str_npc12_personalitymatch_speech|{reg33?My Lady:Sir}, {s11} told me of his dreams for a better world last night.  It sounded crazy, but I think his intentions are good.  Maybe I could help make his dream a reality.
str_npc13_personalitymatch_speech|{reg33?My Lady:Sir}, yesterday {s11} told me about her travels. She knows most of Perisno like the back of her hand.
str_npc14_personalitymatch_speech|My {reg33?Lady:Lord}, did you hear what those bandits did to {s11}? It boils my blood. He deserved better... he was ready to settle down when those bandits struck.
str_npc15_personalitymatch_speech|My good {reg33?madame:sir}, do you know what a coward the Maccavian king is? {s11} was a loyal companion. But just because he grew powerful, the King indicted him! It's not fair.
str_npc16_personalitymatch_speech|{reg33?My Lady:Sir}, in that last battle I learned the true worth of {s11}.  She taught me how to use both sword and bow more efficiently, and it saved my neck out there.
str_npc17_personalitymatch_speech|(Kengesh doesn't complain, you shouldn't see this line)

str_npc3_personalitymatch_speech_b|He cuts through the enemy with ease.  It's bad luck for him that the shipwreck landed him in all this trouble.  But it's good luck for us.

str_npc8_personalitymatch_speech_b|I wish I could fight like that!
str_npc9_personalitymatch_speech_b|He is strong, brave and smart. We are good friends now.
str_npc10_personalitymatch_speech_b|He may be reserved, but I admire that he values Honour and Grace above everything.

str_npc1_rehire_speech|Boss -- it's good to see you again. I know we had our differences in the past, but to tell you the truth, those were some of the best days I've known. And, to tell you the truth, I've had a bit of difficulty finding work. Listen, if you'd be willing to have me back, I'd be willing to sign up with your company again.
str_npc2_rehire_speech|{reg33?Madame:Sir}! It's good to see you again. But I'll confess -- I've been looking for you. I bought a load of goods like I told you I would, loaded them up, and took them back across the steppe -- but wouldn't you know it, I was hit again by Draharans, and lost it all. I guess I'm just destined to fight for my fortune. Also, people tell me that you've done very well for yourself. So tell me, {reg33?madame:sir}, would you have me back?
str_npc3_rehire_speech|Well, hello {reg33?madame:sir}! It is very good to see you again. My heart once again yearns for adventure. Would you be willing to have me back in your company?
str_npc4_rehire_speech|Why hello, captain. I have not been well off since our last meeting. I had a run in with some of the king's men and had to drop my belongings to get away. Do you still have room for me in your company?
str_npc5_rehire_speech|Greetings once again, {reg33?madame:sir}! I wish to return to your company for my time since we parted has been lonesome and it would be nice to have company once again.
str_npc6_rehire_speech|It is good to see you, {reg33?madame:sir}. Everywhere I go, men are in awe of your deeds. I have not had it so well since I left. Wherever I go, I feel my demons returning. My soul is in turmoil. For reasons that I cannot fully explain, I had found peace in your company, even if I had questions about your leadership. Will you allow me to serve with you once again?
str_npc7_rehire_speech|I am glad to see you again, {reg33?madame:sir}, I have found that hiding from my family has been rather harder without company and I would like to return to your band.
str_npc8_rehire_speech|Greetings to you, {playername}. I was wondering if the harsh words spoken between us in the past could be forgotten. I have been hunting among the Nords here, to see if I could find enough men to take back my husband's hall. But I could not find enough men to crew a longship, and those whom I gathered quickly got bored and wandered off -- not, I will add, before they drank away such gold as I had accumulated. So I thought back to the battles we fought together. Those were good days, and profitable ones too.
str_npc9_rehire_speech|My dear, dear {reg33?lady:man}! So good it is to see you! I have sought service with the lords of this land, but have been most grieviously disappointed. Half of them ask me to collect debts from fellow lords, as though I were a banker's errand boy, or chase down his serfs, as though I were a farm overseer. One even asked me to murder one of his creditors! I have looked for you, to see if you would wish me to join you again.
str_npc10_rehire_speech|{reg33?Madame:Sir}! It's good to see you again. But I'll confess -- I've been looking for you. I bought a load of goods like I told you I would, loaded them up, and took them back across the steppe -- but wouldn't you know it, I was hit again by raiders, and lost it all. I guess I'm just destined to fight for my fortune. Also, people tell me that you've done very well for yourself. So tell me, {reg33?madame:sir}, would you have me back?
str_npc11_rehire_speech|Captain! So good to see you! People say that you've been making gold hand over foot. I'm a fidgety old bag of bones, I'll admit. I left you because I wasn't satisfied with the warrior's life, but I spend a bit of time in town and I realize that there are worse things in life than a full belly, honest companions, and the joy of seeing the enemy run before you. So, would you be hiring again
str_npc12_rehire_speech|Captain! It's a fine thing to see an honest face like yours. This world is full of lies. I went home to publish my findings, hired some scribes and made a handful of codices, and waited for the commissions. But it turns out that the universities don't care about real medical knowledge rather than warmed-over Galerian. And publishers -- let me tell you, you never saw anyone so unscrupulous. They rent the books out chapter to by chapter to students to copy, but half of them aren't returned, and those that are have pages soaked in wine, and there's no longer a complete copy of my work anywhere. I'll keep trying, but first I need a bit of money in my pocket, first. Are you looking for a surgeon?
str_npc13_rehire_speech|Well hello there, oh valorous one. I had been hoping to see you again. Everywhere I go, I hear tales and songs of your deeds. I will admit that I felt a twinge of regret that we had parted ways, and, I'll confess, a twinge of jealousy as well at your reputation. I thought that once again I might fight by your side, and thus bask in the reflection of your glory. Perhaps we might ride together again, for a little while?
str_npc14_rehire_speech|Captain. It is good to see you. When last we parted, I was ready to swear that I would not serve you again, but perhaps I judged you too harshly. All over Perisno, men sing your praises. I have tried serving in other lords' armies, and believe me, what I have seen of them restores my opinion of your leadership. If you would have me in your company, I would fight for you again.
str_npc15_rehire_speech|Why hello, {playername}. I can't say I'm entirely displeased to see you. You see, I took on another contract before I left, and sure enough, when it came time to collect the pay, the lord had nothing but talk and excuses and petty little complaints about my handiwork. I can't say I was always happy in your company, but at least I put gold directly into my purse after every battle. You still offering work?
str_npc16_rehire_speech|Captain! They say that you've done well for yourself since we last met. I'll come out and admit that I cursed your name when we parted ways, but thinking back on it you weren't all that bad. All these lords, they're glad enough to send me on little side errands, but they don't much care to have me in their main battle-line. Apparently I spook the men. I've heard it muttered that I'm a witch, or that I eat men's hearts after killing them, or other rot. Not that I mind stabbing a man while he's asleep, but it's a lot more gratifying when he's awake and kicking. So I thought I'd try to find you again, see if you'll take me on.
str_npc17_rehire_speech|It's good to see you, {playername}!  What would you say if I said that wish to join you again?
str_npc1_home_intro|Boss -- did you know that I was born around here, anyway I think I was. It must have been around here somehwere. I swear I know this place, it feels so familier. I should stop drinking.
str_npc2_home_intro|*Swears in a differnt language*
str_npc3_home_intro|Dust, ahhh I love dust in my nostrils. Don't you think that is just lovely. *Zaira laughs as she walks away, obviously tickled that you belived this*
str_npc4_home_intro|The Woods of Ehlerdah. Bah. This place is thick with bandits and outlaws. I once took a prety lass behind a tree. I was taking off her dress when all of a sudden a arrow hit the tree next to us. The poor girl almost had a heart attack as she ran the wrong way... what a sight it was...
str_npc5_home_intro|I was planning to come here until I ran into you. I suppose we can leave soon?
str_npc6_home_intro|Ahh once I had a dream... then I woke up and I met you. I am not certain where I was going with this but alas... this is where I grew up. Lovely isn't it?
str_npc7_home_intro|Do you smell that? Salt fish, rotting flax and river mud. The smells of my childhood. This is where I fell off my horse when I was 12 and broke my leg.
str_npc8_home_intro|I do not care to come back here...
str_npc9_home_intro|My father was one of those who held the line here against the Volheere, when they first tried to push inland from the coast.
str_npc10_home_intro|D'you smell that fresh air? This was my home, before I went abroad in search of coin. It's good to be up in the hills again. It's the smell of freedom.
str_npc11_home_intro|I see the mountains. We must be getting near home. These are the woods where my first bow was made
str_npc12_home_intro|We're passing by the site of one of my greatest medical triumphs, if that interests you. Also when I was a wee lad I scraped my knee on that rock right over there. I didn't cry, as my father was stern in that regard and I had to show my manlihood.
str_npc13_home_intro|Ah, Castle Lyndel! Such a lovely spot, at the foot of the Elven woodlands. Such happy days I spent here, the summer before last.
str_npc14_home_intro|Do you see that fortress up there, on the spur over the valley? That's the majestic Gral Castle. I spent a winter there some years back, trying to train the lord's men.
str_npc15_home_intro|You see that castle up on the hill? Esahil Castle, it's called. I did some work there, not long ago. It's not as showy as some of the other castles in this land, but it's the finest stonework you ever saw.
str_npc16_home_intro|Aye, captain, do you see those? Those are hare tracks in the snow. We must be getting near to my birthplace. I do miss rabbit meat
str_npc17_home_intro|Ah, this beautiful town of Tumatarhun!
str_npc1_home_description|My childhood was very though. I learned how to ride on a early age.
str_npc2_home_description|Volheere not just barbarians. They good to trade.
str_npc3_home_description|Sometimes I wish I could go back to that time.
str_npc4_home_description|Well, you see, the King of Tolrania declared this to be his personal hunting preserve, and said he'd kill any man who as much as strung his bow here. So what happens? Some family goes hungry, and succumbs to the temptation to poach, and the king's sheriff comes along and strings him up and takes his land. His sons, rather than starve, go bandit. And so naturally anyone in the whole valley who feels the need to run away from a debt or a nagging wife or a vengeful noble comes up here to join them, living on wild pigs and berries and the purses of unwary travellers.
str_npc5_home_description|The companion dialogs are a work in progress - Dev team.
str_npc6_home_description|Here in the Vale of Tolranus, our dialect and customs are closer than anywhere else in Perisno to those of the old Perisno Empire. We grow olives and wine, both crops brought to this land from overseas by the emperors, and also follow the old Perisno ways. We keep our pledges and pay our debts.
str_npc7_home_description|Before I was married off, and before I was taken by bandits, I lived here. I was born in a hovel and spent my childhood in the fields. Our landlords were Nord, but we never saw them, merely their cursed minions and overseers. My father, coward that he was, cringed before them.
str_npc8_home_description|I was born around here. My father was a loyal soldier of a lord around here.
str_npc9_home_description|It was a glorious battle. They still tell stories about it.
str_npc10_home_description|I had a happy childhood over here.
str_npc11_home_description|I left my home at an early age.
str_npc12_home_description|The lord over there in  Serin Castle had the dropsy, and had requested a doctor to treat him. Like a typical university-educated doctor, he went right to Galerian for a cure. Galerian commends sun-metal for dropsy. Now most of Galerian's writings were useless back in the days of the Perisnoan emperors when they were first written down, and they're doubly worthless today, but sometimes he hits upon the right cure by chance: sun-metal does cure some kinds of dropsy in small doses. However, sun-metal in large doses is poison, something that the Galerian-worshippers never grasped.
str_npc13_home_description|.
str_npc14_home_description|I have some good memories of the time I spend there. The lord was very nice to me, he gave me food and shelter. He also paid me well for all the effort I put in the training of his men. But when winter ended I left the castle and continued my journey. I hope the men I trained are good soldiers now.
str_npc15_home_description|Like most castles that last around here, it's got foundations that are old Imperial Perisnoan. You can't see them any more with all the rebuilding, but the slabs are the size of a house. They must have been real sorcerors back in those days, because I don't see how they moved those things otherwise. Beautiful location, too -- Culmarr sits right in front of the pass leading out of Perisno, which allows the lord to charge a pretty penny in tolls during the three months of the year that it's not snowed in.
str_npc16_home_description|The snows in these valleys don't melt until late in the year, and the land is hard to plough. You can grow a bit of barley, but not much else. But there's wealth here in the woods: deer, rabbit and lynx, meat and furs, and the mountains have iron, and traders would ship enough saltfish up the river from the coast to keep the people fed for the winter.

str_npc9_home_recap|I am from here.
str_npc10_home_recap|I hope some day to buy land there. But I had a mind to see a bit of the world first, so I took my crossbow and went off to the wars.
str_npc11_home_recap|I was born in the train of an army, and lived all my days in the train of an army. My folk are from Lesbere, however, so I guess that's as much home to me as anywhere.

str_npc13_home_recap|Oh, far away from here, my {reg33?lady:lord}, else you would already have heard about me, and would not need to ask such things.
str_npc14_home_recap|I was not born far from here.
str_npc15_home_recap|I'm from over the hills. But Perisno is where the money is to be made, these days, if your trade is siegecraft.
str_npc16_home_recap|I was born near here.

str_npc1_kingsupport_1|That is a great idea. I will take my leave. I hear there a small ship of men landed from the Klyrintin Empire. Some of them may be persuded to join our cause in spreading the word about your... well greatness. It may be a long shot but it's a differnt angle we can take.
str_npc2_kingsupport_1|Well, captain -- I will need to talk to the others Jarls. The Volheere could be persuaded to join our cause!
str_npc3_kingsupport_1|Well, my lord -- My friends back in Drahara might hear what you have to say. May we unite all the Swiftriders in Perisno!
str_npc4_kingsupport_1|Well, captain, Since I no longer have noble support, my rogue knights need someone to follow. Our followers will surely join our cause.
str_npc5_kingsupport_1|Oh the olden times were... so... Anyway enough of this. I shall visit some old friends and I shall convince them in following you as their rightful king. You may not hear from me for a while.
str_npc6_kingsupport_1|Just a forthnight ago I had a dream about you becoming King one day! Oh how real it was. Let me loose for a short while and I will make dreams come true! Oh listen to me yip. Let me be of. I shall return soon!
str_npc7_kingsupport_1|My Captain, I am certain the nobles in Tolrania will greet your rise to the throne with open arms. If not then we shall slit there throats. What am I thinking, of course they will. I will make sure of it!
str_npc8_kingsupport_1|If you gave me permission {playername}, I will spread the word to the ladies of the Hakkon Empire that you will finnaly lead them out of the opressive ways they have endured for so long. We have been looked upon as less for far to long
str_npc9_kingsupport_1|I still have some very powerful friends back in Maccavia that I can sway to your claim to the throne. They to have be wronged by Agathor Rex and would long nothing more then they push a spike through a skull, mind my tone. If I have your permission, {reg33?my lady:sir}.
str_npc10_kingsupport_1|Well, {reg33?Sister:Brother}, I know some traders back in Drahara who would be willing to follow your rule. If you made a few small changes helping us of course.
str_npc11_kingsupport_1|Hmm... I suppose I could sway some Elven Warriors to fight for your cause. Let me see what I can do.
str_npc12_kingsupport_1|Your leg wound hasn't healed yet, let me... Oh very well! I shall scour the land and visit my friends and convince them that you are the true king! Maybe you can end this bloodshed for good.
str_npc13_kingsupport_1|That would be a fine thing, {reg33?brother:sister}! Many is the tale of the hero who has proven his worthiness to wear a crown through valor.
str_npc14_kingsupport_1|Well,{reg33?my lady:sir}, As a noble from The Reich I can assure you my words won't fall on deaf ears. Let me gallop around from city to city to spread your claim to the throne!
str_npc15_kingsupport_1|I know so few people In Perisno. Alas I shall spread your word like I have spread the coming on the Zann! Everyone will want to follow your army in crushing this deadly vermin.
str_npc16_kingsupport_1|Why not, captain? I'm sure you'd make a fine {reg33?queen/king} -- I shall return to Elintor and speak to close friends.
str_npc17_kingsupport_1|I cannot promise you anything {playername}, but alas give me some time off. I may be able to muster something.
str_npc1_kingsupport_2|I only ask that you make a few of my closest allies your personal guards if you do one day become king.
str_npc2_kingsupport_2|I must tell you the Volheerian warriors have deep pockets. If you do not uphold your end of things in paying them well things might turn sour very quickly. But do not worry I am certain you understand this.
str_npc3_kingsupport_2|I would, my {reg33?lady:lord}. But I would strongly recommend that you look into backing more draharian warriors in your army, if that suits your taste, {reg33?my lady:sir}.
str_npc4_kingsupport_2|Of course, {reg33?my lady:captain}. The trick is now to get others to follow you. As you know, one's lineage is a great determinant of one's worthiness. Perhaps you have a long-lost ancestor of whom you have not told me?
str_npc5_kingsupport_2|I would. But there is something I should say, on behalf of the Olden Perisno Empire, I pray that you uplhold the old laws once you become king!
str_npc6_kingsupport_2|I would. I would tell anyone who listens of your deeds on behalf of the weak and helpless, of your ability to lead men against great odds and triumph, and tell them that if you were to become {king/queen}, there would be one law and one peace -- from the Elven woodlands to the Drache mountains, from the high steppe to the Maccavian shore.
str_npc7_kingsupport_2|Yes, captain, I would. If you uplhold everthing you promise I can certain you would make a great {reg33?queen:king}.
str_npc8_kingsupport_2|I would -- on one condition. You'd be in wherever you want to rule, but I'd rule my own hall. And if I had a dispute with any other of your thegns, be it over land, livestock, or blood, you'd let us settle it sword to sword, according to the old ways, and let the heavens decide who is in the right.
str_npc9_kingsupport_2|I would, {reg33?madame:sir}, and others would too. But here's what I think -- you need to show the noble lords that you won't bend to every little wim. You must show true spirit, and every Meccavian will follow you!
str_npc10_kingsupport_2|Certainly, {reg33Sister:Brother}. But I'd ask that you consider a thought of mine. If you became {reg33?queen:king}, then I'd like that you open a order of trading that is protected from the common thieves and bandits. Even if this means a larger force that is accompanying the caravans. As a trader I know firsthand the ruin we can fall into when we get robbed by some savage thieves!
str_npc11_kingsupport_2|Of course, I would! My Elven brothers long for Perisno to return as it once was. I feel that you can bring it back...
str_npc12_kingsupport_2|Of course, captain.  But if I have learned anything in my travels in this land, Perisno needs a change. A king... one that shows fierce devotion to the throne and care for the commonfolk
str_npc13_kingsupport_2|It does not hurt to be the subject of an epic, recited around campfires and hearthfires, describing one's deeds.
str_npc14_kingsupport_2|I would indeed, sir. I think you can unite this land, and then we'll be able to raise an army such as Perisno has not seen for many generations -- Hakkon lances, Tolraninan archers, Draharian spears, Drache swords, Maccvian axes, and Elintoran archers, and take it over the mountains to subdue all the lands that the Perisno emperors once held sway.
str_npc15_kingsupport_2|I would. We need a strong Perisno, a strong ruler in order to deafeat the Zann! As we say in Zann, YA WU LAK KAAAK!
str_npc16_kingsupport_2|Of course, my {reg33?lady:lord}. Everyone In Elintor shall sing your name. There is one thing I wish to discuss further once the time comes. I wish to continue my noble line with... oh... we shall speak at a later time.
str_npc17_kingsupport_2|(Kengesh just doesn't, you shouldn't see this line)
str_npc1_kingsupport_2a|Please go on...
str_npc2_kingsupport_2a|Please continue...
str_npc3_kingsupport_2a|Please continue...
str_npc4_kingsupport_2a|Of course - let me tell you all about him.
str_npc5_kingsupport_2a|Please go on...
str_npc6_kingsupport_2a|Splendid
str_npc7_kingsupport_2a|Well, yes, I will try to keep order...
str_npc8_kingsupport_2a|Fair enough
str_npc9_kingsupport_2a|That seems sensible enough...
str_npc10_kingsupport_2a|Of course - I would give my subjects that right
str_npc11_kingsupport_2a|See if you can recall that prophesy.
str_npc12_kingsupport_2a|Interesting. Please go on...
str_npc13_kingsupport_2a|Why, yes, that you are.
str_npc14_kingsupport_2a|Please go on...
str_npc15_kingsupport_2a|Well-spoken, my good man
str_npc16_kingsupport_2a|Interesting... Please continue
str_npc17_kingsupport_2a|(Kengesh just doesn't, you shouldn't see this line)
str_npc1_kingsupport_2b|Well. We saw how that turned out...
str_npc2_kingsupport_2b|I do not ask for their support, as they would no doubt wish to make a profit on the transaction. I wish you would have thought more before you acted.
str_npc3_kingsupport_2b|I have no intention of hobbling myself in that way.
str_npc4_kingsupport_2b|I will have no part of this.
str_npc5_kingsupport_2b|I said that I wished to be {reg33?queen:king}, not that I wished to involve myself in the minutiae of nomadism.
str_npc6_kingsupport_2b|I'm not sure that I can quite deliver all that.
str_npc7_kingsupport_2b|I think you're maybe taking the idea of the king's peace a bit too far, there.
str_npc8_kingsupport_2b|That's a pretty tall condition.
str_npc9_kingsupport_2b|I'm not sure that implementing your idea would be as 'simple' as you think.
str_npc10_kingsupport_2b|Hmm. Let me think it over.
str_npc11_kingsupport_2b|Ah... I'll have my hand back, please.
str_npc12_kingsupport_2b|Enough, sir. I will not have you mock our traditions.
str_npc13_kingsupport_2b|Hmm. I'm not sure about that.
str_npc14_kingsupport_2b|Actually, I was looking forward to a bit of rest after becoming {reg33?queen:king}...
str_npc15_kingsupport_2b|{reg33?Queen:King} of the Clerks, maybe, Enough of such talk.
str_npc16_kingsupport_2b|No offense, but I'm not sure that's the approach I'd take.
str_npc17_kingsupport_2b|(Kengesh just doesn't, you shouldn't see this line)
str_npc1_kingsupport_3|If I could go about this land for a few weeks, telling the common folk that you were going to amnesty their kinfolk like the emperors of old -- well, they would start talking of you as the Emperor, and that would pave your way to the throne. Shall I do that, Boss?
str_npc2_kingsupport_3|If you like, captain, I can take a few weeks to visit the guildhalls and caravanseries where I have contacts, and explain to them that, in you, they will have a {reg33?ruler:king} who will check the rapacious nobles, who, with their tariffs and taxes, would strangle commerce for the sake of a few extra aurums to spend on their wars and their feasts. What do you say to that, captain?
str_npc3_kingsupport_3|If you were to make such a pledge, {reg33?madame:sir}, I think that it would help many of the lords of this land overcome any reluctance that they might have. If your aim is to restore the old Perisnoan system, then arguably you are a more legitimate {reg33?ruler:king} then any of these come-lately usurpers. Give me leave for several weeks, {reg33?madame:sir}, and I will let it be known in the noble courts and merchant houses of this land that you intend to restore their ancient rights.
str_npc4_kingsupport_3|Yes -- I think I have heard of that line, In fact, I can envision {reg33?her:his} entire genealogy. If you give me leave, 'Majesty', I shall travel about the villages and castles of this realm over the next several weeks, spreading word of your royal birth. Of course, I would hope that you would remember your faithful subject, when it comes to distributing lands...
str_npc5_kingsupport_3|Anyway, lord, in these sorry times the men of the great estates have taken to blocking our passage, charging us huge fees to cross. It is a great burden on my people, Bahadur. If I could take a few weeks to let the men of the steppes know that you would support the restoration of our ancient rights, well, then, I think you would find many who would support you as khan, And when men speak of you as khan, that's the first step to becoming one.
str_npc6_kingsupport_3|Very well. Although I am now a stranger to my family, I have entered many a noble's hall in your train, and I reckon I would be welcome again. I shall go about this land and tell the nobles that when you are {reg33?queen:king}, you will strive your hardest to protect the weak and to crush discord, so that no man will raise his hand against another with impunity, and one day, perhaps, the sin of fraticide will be no more.
str_npc7_kingsupport_3|I'll tell you what, captain. Give me a few weeks and I'll go to some of these villages -- stinking hovels that they are, but I reckon I can take care of myself these days. I'll tell the people there that once you unify this land, you'll wipe it clean of banditry. You'll erect gallows along the roads and keep them well-stocked with broken-necked thieves, so that every passerby knows that the wages of indecency is death.
str_npc8_kingsupport_3|Good! Then give me a few weeks and I'll go about the courts of this land, letting it be known that you're a {reg33?ruler:king} who respects the thegns and their ancient rights. You won't go sticking your royal nose where it doesn't belong, and Perisno will be the better for it.
str_npc9_kingsupport_3|It's perfectly sensible, {reg33?madame:sir} -- and we'll be free of those cursed writs and burghers' petitions and scrolls that take up all of my time and yours, when we should both be out fighting for the glory of your kingdom. Give me leave and I'll spread word among the noble lords of this land that you're here to restore the old ways, and I'll bet there will plenty who will follow you into battle.
str_npc10_kingsupport_3|Well then, {reg33?Sister:Brother}, give me leave for a few weeks and I can go about this land, letting the common folk know that you will rule justly and equitably, and that lord and common alike should be one before your law. Men will speak of you as {king/queen}, and that's a good start to becoming one...
str_npc11_kingsupport_3|I can't recall now, but if you let me go back to my home, I could find an old greybeard who remembers it in full. And, I could put it around that you've got the mark of kings on your hand! There's many where I come from who are waiting for a just ruler, and a man's hands tell all that's worth knowing about him. Give me a few weeks, and I'll reckon I can have quite a few expecting you to be their next {reg33?queen:king}.
str_npc12_kingsupport_3|But you know what? There was no 'imperial' law when it came to the crown. Sometimes one emperor handed the empire to his son. Sometimes he split it between his generals. Sometimes one emperor murdered the last. There's no right 'Perisnoan' way to crown a {king/king or queen}, and thus it makes sense that the crown should go to the one most fit to govern -- which would be you, naturally. Give me a couple of weeks, and I'll write a tract which proves it and find a copyist to post a version in every town tavern in the land. What do you say to that idea, captain?
str_npc13_kingsupport_3|Then give me leave for a few weeks, oh gallant one, and I will spin such a tale as would stir even the dullest heart, inspiring admiration for your virtues, compassion for your hardships, and indignation at those who would stand in your way. I assume, of course, that I would be able to take a certain amount of poetic license with the details?
str_npc14_kingsupport_3|Give me leave for a few weeks, {reg33?madame:sir}, and I will let all the worthy men of this land know that you are the one to unite not just Perisno, but all the other Perisnoan dominions. For according to my thinking, no one should be {king/king or queen} here unless they have the capacity to rule the entirety of the realm -- and you alone have demonstrated such a capacity, {reg33?madame:sir}.
str_npc15_kingsupport_3|I'm glad you think so. Here's what I suggest. I know men in the guilds here, men like me, who've been shafted and shaken down until they can take no more. Here's what I'll tell them -- you're honest. You respect the burghers. You'll pay your debts. You won't beggar your subjects.
str_npc16_kingsupport_3|Give me leave for a few weeks, and I'll do a little tour of my former employers' castles. I'll sing them a pretty song about what you'll do as {reg33?queen:king}, about all the ancient freedoms you'll restore -- let them rob their tenants and tax the merchants and fight their wars and spend themselves silly without a thought to tomorrow, as a noble ought! What do you say to that, captain?
str_npc17_kingsupport_3|(Kengesh just doesn't, you shouldn't see this line)
str_npc1_intel_mission|Well, Boss, as it happens, I have a few cousins over in {s17}, and unlike some in my family, they can still stand the sight of me. They deal in horses --- I've even been able to supply them with stock from time to time -- and so they get to pick up a bit of the gossip round the castles and great halls of the {s18}. I could go over there for a few days and tell you what I find out.
str_npc2_intel_mission|{reg33?My lady:Sir}, if you're interested in events in {s18}, I can still make contact with my old trading partners in {s17}. They're usually well-informed about political events.
str_npc3_intel_mission|Captain, although I cannot return to my father's house in {s17}, I still may make contact with my sister. She will be privy to the councils of the great merchant houses, and may tell us much about the state of the {s18}.
str_npc4_intel_mission|Captain, if you could spare me for a few days, I would like to look up an old comrade-in-arms in {s17}, who has from time to time led a small company in the pay of the {s18}. He is a good man, the kind who speaks little and listens much. I'm sure over a drink or two he might let us know which way the political winds are blowing in those parts.
str_npc5_intel_mission|If you like, {playername}, I can take a few days to visit my mother's sister's people. They work in a caravanserie in {s17}, and hear the news from all across the {s18}. They may have some gossip about the feuds and rivaries of the great lords, if that is of interest to you.
str_npc6_intel_mission|Captain -- while I am not strictly welcome in {s17}, I would be able to make contact with some former tenants of an estate of mine nearby. I granted them ownership after my abrupt departure, and they are now well-placed in society, and also less inclined than most to hold my crime against me. If you give me a few days, I may be able to collect some interesting information about the {s18}.
str_npc7_intel_mission|Captain. When I left my former home in {s17}, I had promised myself that I would never return, except for the purposes of taking out vengeance on those who wronged me. Perhaps I was rash. I am occasionally curious as to how my family is getting along. Perhaps I can bring them some gifts, to let them know what I have made of myself! Any rate, they are wretched people, but just as a cringing dog keeps its ear to the wind, so do they. They may have useful information about the {s18}, if you would give me a few days to pay them a visit.
str_npc8_intel_mission|If you have any interest in the events in the {s18}, a former shield-companion of mine retired and now keeps a farm near {s17}. He keeps in contact with a number of other old warriors. I could visit him for a few days, and learn more about what is going on there.
str_npc9_intel_mission|{reg33?My lady:Sir} -- it has been some time since I sampled the delights of {s17}, where gentlefolk such as myself are wont to partake of the hospitality of the most puissant and generous lord. If you wish, I could perhaps go there, and let you know something about the concerns that weigh on the minds of the great peers of the {s18}.
str_npc10_intel_mission|Captain -- I was thinking that some of my old mates in the garrison at {s17} would be glad to see me. They are good lads, and would never betray the city, but like me they have no particular affection for the bluebloods that command them, and may be willing to slip a little political gossip our way. The gentry are always falling out over one little thing or the other, but the lads might be able to know if there's real dissent brewing.
str_npc11_intel_mission|{reg33?Lassie:Laddie} -- I was thinking that it's been a while since I visited my kinfolk in {s17}. They've been kind enough to me over the years, helping me out during the lean times, so I feel I'd like to share some of my newfound fortune with them. I've also bought wholesale enough times from the Praven grain merchants for them to trust me. I'd reckon they might be persuaded to spill a few tidbits about events in the {s18}, if that would interest you.
str_npc12_intel_mission|If you wish, Captain, I would not mind taking the time to pay a visit to a pupil of mine, now employed by the lord of {s17}. I had great hopes for him, but I have heard that he has lately endorsed the use of muskmelon for the treatment of palsy, on the grounds that its cold essence offsets an abundance of yellow bile. This is a travesty of medicine, and I must journey there swiftly to correct him. While I am there, if you wish, I could question him on the latest trends within the {s18}, a matter which may interest you.
str_npc13_intel_mission|Oh valiant one! With your permission, I was thinking that I might pay a visit to the dales near {s17}. I try not to revisit old pastures, but I must confess a certain curiosity as to how a comely shepherdess of my former acquaintance is getting along. On the way, I may attempt to stop in at the castle. I suspect that it would not be terribly difficult for me to charm my way into the lord's hall, and I may be able to provide you with the latest news from the {s18}.
str_npc14_intel_mission|Captain... As you may know, I helped train the garrison of {s17}. One of their number has lately been in touch with me, and suggests that if I were to visit him, he could pass me information on events within the {s18}. I am willing to do this, if you can spare me. While it is a great disgrace to be a traitor, there is no dishonor in making use of one.
str_npc15_intel_mission|Captain. As you may know, I have for some time harbored a wish to go to {s17}, and study the masonry -- one of the finest examples of the old Perisnoan style. As it happens, one of my colleagues is currently engaged there doing repair work on the curtain wall. While his sense of professional obligation I think would prevent him, rightfully, from disclosing to me any weaknesses in its defenses, I suspect that he would not be averse to offering up his opinion on the general state of the {s18}, if that is of interest to you.
str_npc16_intel_mission|Oy, Captain! I had a mind to pay a visit to my old haunts at {s17}. Let's just say that the lord and lady of the place had commissioned a certain service from me, and had been a bit lax about payment. However, a certain sparkly bauble in the lady's possession will fit the bill nicely. I see no need to trouble them by letting them know about my visit, but I could have a wee chat with my old friend the castle steward, who'll be letting me into the place, about goings-on in the {s18}.
str_npc17_intel_mission|(Kengesh just doesn't, you shouldn't see this line)
str_npc1_fief_acceptance|You'd make me lord of {s17}, Boss? Well, that would be the kindest thing that anyone has ever done for me in a long time. Heh. I'll make the most of it -- you can count on that. I have to say, though -- I'm not sure how the other lords of this realm will react, when they find old Borcha in their august company.
str_npc2_fief_acceptance|{s17} as a fief? Well, I've always thought in terms of buying and selling goods, not in terms of governing anything. But now that you mention it, I bet I could make that place turn a fair bit of revenue. I thank you, {my Lord/my lady} -- this is a very kind turn that you have done me.
str_npc3_fief_acceptance|{reg33?My lady:Sire}, it is most generous of you to offer me {s17}. I would be pleased to hold it, and dedicate myself to the moral and material uplift of its inhabitants.
str_npc4_fief_acceptance|It is good of you to grant me {s17} as a fief -- and most appropriate. Proud indeed is the king who has a baron of the House of Rolf as {his/her} vassal.
str_npc5_fief_acceptance|Bahadur -- I would be most pleased to hold {s17}. I will send word to the hills, to my kinsmen, and let them know that there is honorable gold to be earned serving under me in your armies -- and they will come flocking to fight for you!
str_npc6_fief_acceptance|{reg33?Lady:Sire} -- I am surprised that you find me worthy to govern men, as I am just beginning to learn to govern myself. But if you indeed wish it, I would be most honored to hold {s17} in your name, and dedicate myself to the protection of those who live there.
str_npc7_fief_acceptance|Aye, I'll hold {s17} -- and give it a reputation that strikes fear in the hearts of thieves and brigands across Perisno. Thank you, {sire/madame}, for this opportunity.
str_npc8_fief_acceptance|You'd make me a thegn? Well, I suppose that I can postpone reclaiming my inheritance for a little while longer, and make my great hall at {s17}. Some day, I may travel over the seas to take back what is mine, but until then, I would be pleased to raise a band of battle-hardened Nords to fight under your banner.
str_npc9_fief_acceptance|{reg33?My lady:Sire}, I was cheated of my inheritance -- but now, with this offer of this estate, you make right what was wrong. It would give me the greatest honor to serve you, to fight for you, and to hold this land in fief to you.
str_npc10_fief_acceptance|You'd make me a lord? Well, no thank you -- but if you would call me 'tribune' -- the tribunes being the people's servants in the old times -- then I suppose I could bring myself to run {s17} for you. I'd put food in the bellies of the hungry, and raise a fine force of Elven archers to fight on your behalf, {Brother/Sister}. But I can't promise that the real blue-bloods will enjoy rubbing shoulders with me in your councils.
str_npc11_fief_acceptance|Ay! You'd grant old Katrin a title of nobility? Well, I'd be daft to turn you down, now wouldn't I? My, the strange turns that life takes... Fancy this old bag of bones becoming a great peer of the realm of Perisno.
str_npc12_fief_acceptance|Well, {reg33?my lady:sire}, I'd have you know that don't believe in the holding of land in fief to the king. Farmers and landholders should govern their own affairs, under the distant watch of the sovereign. That being said, Perisno has seen far too much bloodshed for us to turn the social order on its head right now. Give me that land, and I'll endeavor to prepare it for a brighter future -- if not in this generation, than perhaps in the next.
str_npc13_fief_acceptance|How generous of you, captain! You and I have traveled Perisno, and I come out of this as a lord! I may bring a few warriors of Hylr into my retinue as well, so that we may stay true to our roots.
str_npc14_fief_acceptance|You do me a great honor, captain. In Geroia, a youngest son such as myself has few opportunities to earn a fief of his own. But here, in Perisno, there is still the chance for a man to win with his sword what was denied him by his birth! I shall hold {s17} as your vassal, and raise an army to fight for your glory and for mine.
str_npc15_fief_acceptance|Well, {reg33?my lady:sire}, that's a gracious act, and marks you as the kind of monarch who can save this sorry land from the incompetence of the current batch. I suspect a lot of the noble lords around here will think that a commoner like me isn't fit to hold a fief. Well, when they see what I do with it, and what revenues I can bring in, they'll change their tune!
str_npc16_fief_acceptance|Oh, that's most generous of you, {reg33?my lady:sire}. I've been in and out of many a great hall or manor -- not always with the master's permission, I should add -- but I never thought I'd own one myself. Let me think... When I collect my first year's rents, what baubles shall I buy myself?
str_npc17_fief_acceptance|You're granting me a fief? This is very kind of you. Thank you, I'll do my best to help your kingdom and its people.
str_npc3_woman_to_woman|My lady, if you don't mind me saying -- I think by now you have proven yourself to be one of the great warriors of this realm. Yet strangely, no king has come forward to offer you a fief. Perhaps it is because you are a woman. No matter -- I personally believe that you will take your place among the great lords of this realm, even if you have to fight twice as long and twice as hard to receive your due!
str_npc7_woman_to_woman|Captain. If you don't mind me saying, you have fought long and hard against the scum of Perisno, and with their defeat, you make this land a better place. You are well deserving of a fief of your own -- and I suspect that if you were not a woman, a king would have offered you one by now. That is the way of the men in this sorry land: they let us stand in the front of the battleline to take the enemy's blows, but when it comes to a division of the spoils, they expect us to head to the rear.
str_npc8_woman_to_woman|Excuse me, {playername}. I would like to offer you my congratulations -- it seems that you are well on your way to making a name for yourself as a warrior to be feared. If you were a man, I suspect the kings of this land would be falling over themselves to make you their vassal. Alas, in this world, women like ourselves must fight twice as hard to receive what is only our due.
str_npc11_woman_to_woman|Aye, lassie, I just can't help thinking to myself -- you've made quite a name for yourself, haven't you? Fighting and marching up and down the length of the land. Why, I suspect if you were a man, some king would have offered you a fief by now. Well, you may still get what you deserve -- you'll just have to prove yourself a bit more.
str_npc16_woman_to_woman|Oy, Captain -- if you don't mind me saying, you've made quite a name for yourself in these parts. I suspect that if you were a man, a king would have offered you a fief by now. But we ladies should come to expect things like that. Men will find any excuse not to reward us for our work, so if we take a fancy to a bit of land somewhere, maybe we should just reach out and take it. That's the way I look at the world, anyway.
str_comment_intro_liege_affiliated|I am told that you are pledged to one of the pretenders who disputes my claim to the crown of Perisno. But we may still talk.
str_comment_intro_famous_liege|Your fame runs before you! Perhaps it is time that you sought a liege worthy of your valor.
str_comment_intro_famous_martial|Your fame runs before you! Perhaps we shall test each other's valor in a tournament, or on the battlefield!
str_comment_intro_famous_badtempered|I've heard of you. Well, I'm not one for bandying words, so if you have anything to say, out with it.
str_comment_intro_famous_pitiless|I know your name. It strikes fear in men's hearts. That is good. Perhaps we should speak together, some time.
str_comment_intro_famous_cunning|Ah, yes. At last we meet. You sound like a good {reg33?woman:man} to know. Let us speak together, from time to time.
str_comment_intro_famous_sadistic|I know your name -- and from what I hear, I'll warrant that many a grieving widow knows too. But that is no concern of mine.
str_comment_intro_famous_goodnatured|I've heard of you! It's very good to finally make your acquaintance.
str_comment_intro_famous_upstanding|I know your name. They say you are a most valiant warrior. I can only hope that your honour and mercy matches your valor.
str_comment_intro_noble_liege|I see that you carry a noble{reg33?'s:man's} banner, although I do not recognize the device. Know that I am always looking for good {men/warriors} to fight for me, once they prove themselves to be worthy of my trust.
str_comment_intro_noble_martial|I see that you carry a nobleman's banner, but I do not recognize the device. No matter -- a brave {reg33?warrior:man}'s home is all the world, or so they say!
str_comment_intro_noble_badtempered|I don't recognize the device on your banner. No doubt another foreigner come to our lands, as if we didn't have so many here already.
str_comment_intro_noble_pitiless|I see that you carry a nobleman's banner, but I do not recognize the device. Another vulture come to grow fat on the leftovers of war, no doubt!
str_comment_intro_noble_cunning|I see that you carry a nobleman's banner, but I do not recognize the device. Still, it is always worthwhile to make the acquaintance of {reg33?women:men} who may one day prove themselves to be great warriors.
str_comment_intro_noble_sadistic|I see that you carry a nobleman's banner, but I do not recognize the device. Perhaps you are the bastard {reg33?daughter:son} of a puffed-up cattle thief? Or perhaps you stole it?
str_comment_intro_noble_goodnatured|I see that you carry a nobleman's banner, but I do not recognize the device. Forgive my ignorance, {reg33?my lady:sir}! It is good to make your acquaintance.
str_comment_intro_noble_upstanding|I see that you carry a nobleman's banner, but I do not recognize the device. No doubt you have come to Perisno in search of wealth and glory. If this indeed is the case, then I only ask that you show mercy to those poor souls caught in the path of war.
str_comment_intro_common_liege|You may be of common birth, but know that I am always looking for good men to fight for me, if they can prove themselves to be worthy of my trust.
str_comment_intro_common_martial|Perhaps you are not of gentle birth, but even a commoner, be {reg33?she:he} of sufficient valor, may make something of {himself/herself} some day.
str_comment_intro_common_badtempered|Speak quickly, if you have anything to say, for I have no time to be bandying words with common soldiers of fortune.
str_comment_intro_common_pitiless|You have the look of a mercenary, another vulture come to grow fat on the misery of this land.
str_comment_intro_common_cunning|Well... I have not heard of you, but you have the look of a {reg33?woman:man} who might make something of {reg33?her:him}self, some day.
str_comment_intro_common_sadistic|Normally I cut the throats of impudent commoners who barge into my presence uninvited, but I am in a good mood today.
str_comment_intro_common_goodnatured|Well, you look like a good enough sort.
str_comment_intro_common_upstanding|Peace to you, and always remember to temper your valor with mercy, your courage with honour.
str_comment_intro_female_famous_liege|I have heard much about you. Some {reg65?women:men} may fear a {reg33?woman:man} who is versed in the art of war, but I for one will not turn away hands that can grip a sword, should their owner be brave and loyal.
str_comment_intro_female_famous_martial|I have heard much about you. They say that you are the equal of even the bravest of {reg33?women:men} in your prowess at arms. Perhaps one day I shall try my valor against yours, either in a tournament or on the battlefield!
str_comment_intro_female_famous_badtempered|I've heard of talk of you -- the {reg33?woman:man} who knows how to fight like a {reg33?man:woman}.

str_comment_intro_female_noble_liege|It is not often that I meet a {reg33?woman:man} who aspires to lead {reg33?warriors:men} into battle. But these are dark and troubled times, and I for one will not turn away hands that can grip a sword, should their owner be brave and loyal.
str_comment_intro_female_noble_martial|I do not recognize the device on your banner, but clearly you are a {reg33?lady:boy} of rank. Please consider me your most humble servant.
str_comment_intro_female_noble_badtempered|I don't recognize the device on that banner. Clearly another foreigner come to our lands, bringing their strange ways.
str_comment_intro_female_noble_pitiless|I see that you carry a noble's banner, but I do not recognize the device... You should know, {reg33?lady:boy}, that in Perisno it is the {women/men} to ride to war, and if you seek to overturn the natural order of things, you will find your fair head stuck on a pike -- like that of any other rebel!
str_comment_intro_female_noble_cunning|It is not unheard-of for a {reg33?woman:man} to seek {reg33?her:his} fortune on the battlefields of Perisno, but neither is it usual. I shall be most interested in your progress.
str_comment_intro_female_noble_sadistic|You appear to be of noble rank, but I don't recognize your banner. Clearly, another foreigner come to our shores -- no doubt from a land where {women/men} are weak, and the {men/women} ride to war in their place!

Please do not take this amiss, {reg33?my lady:dear boy}, for you have every right to protect yourself, but I cannot pretend to be fully comfortable with your decision to fight in battle.

str_surrender_demand_martial|The odds are not in your favor today. You may fight us, but there is also no shame if you yield now.
str_surrender_demand_quarrelsome|I've got you cornered. Give up, or I'll ride you down like a dog.
str_surrender_demand_pitiless|You cannot defeat me, and I'll teach you a painful lesson if you try. Yield!
str_surrender_demand_cunning|You are outmatched today. Give up -- if not for your own sake, then think of your men!
str_surrender_demand_sadistic|Surrender or I'll gut you like a fish!
str_surrender_demand_goodnatured|We have the advantage of you. Yield, and you will be well-treated.
str_surrender_demand_upstanding|You may fight us, but many of your men will be killed, and you will probably lose. Yield, and spare us both the unnecessary bloodshed.
str_surrender_offer_default|Stop! I yield!
str_surrender_offer_martial|Stop! I yield!
str_surrender_offer_quarrelsome|Enough! You win today, you dog! Ach, the shame of it!
str_surrender_offer_pitiless|I yield! You have won. Cursed be this day!
str_surrender_offer_cunning|Stop! I yield to you!
str_surrender_offer_sadistic|I give up! I give up! Call back your dogs!
str_surrender_offer_goodnatured|I yield! Congratulations on your victory, {sir/madame}!
str_surrender_offer_upstanding|I yield! Grant me the honours of war, and do yourself credit!
str_lord_declines_negotiation_offer_default|That may be, but I wish to fight with you
str_lord_declines_negotiation_offer_martial|That may be, but it is my duty to fight with you
str_lord_declines_negotiation_offer_quarrelsome|Hah! I want to fight with you
str_lord_declines_negotiation_offer_pitiless|Why should I care? I wish to fight with you
str_lord_declines_negotiation_offer_cunning|Ah. Unfortunately, you see, I wish to fight with you
str_lord_declines_negotiation_offer_sadistic|Still your tongue! You will have need of it shortly, while begging for mercy
str_lord_declines_negotiation_offer_goodnatured|I'm sorry -- I can't just let you ride away. No hard feelings?
str_lord_declines_negotiation_offer_upstanding|That may be, but my duty to my liege requires me to fight with you
str_prisoner_released_default|You have my gratitude, {sir/madame}. I shall not forget your kindness.
str_prisoner_released_martial|You are indeed a {man/woman} of honour, {sir/madame}. I shall not forget this!
str_prisoner_released_quarrelsome|I'm free? Well... Good bye, then.
str_prisoner_released_pitiless|Thank you. When you are finally defeated, I will request for your death to be swift and merciful. Unless, that is, you care to join us... Good bye, for now.
str_prisoner_released_cunning|Am I? You are a good {man/woman}. I will try to find a way to repay you.
str_prisoner_released_sadistic|Am I? So refined is your cruelty, that you would rather see me free and humiliated, than in chains. Enjoy your triumph!
str_prisoner_released_goodnatured|You are indeed a {man/woman} of honour, {sir/madame}. I shall not forget this!
str_prisoner_released_upstanding|You are indeed a {man/woman} of honour, {sir/madame}. I shall not forget this!

str_enemy_meet_quarrelsome|Who the hell are you?
str_enemy_meet_pitiless|Who are you? Speak, so that I may know whom I slay.
str_enemy_meet_cunning|Tell me your name. It is always good to know your enemy.
str_enemy_meet_sadistic|Who are you? Speak quick, before I cut your tongue out.
str_enemy_meet_goodnatured|What is your name, {sir/madame}? If we come to blows, I would know whom I fight.
str_enemy_meet_upstanding|Who are you, who would come in arms to dispute our righteous cause?
str_battle_won_default|You have proven yourself a most valued ally, today.
str_battle_won_martial|There is no greater fortune than the chance to show one's valor on the field of arms!
str_battle_won_quarrelsome|Hah! We showed those bastards a thing or two, there, didn't we?
str_battle_won_pitiless|Together, we will make the foe learn to fear our names, and to quail at our coming!
str_battle_won_cunning|Now, we must be sure to press our advantage, so that the blood shed today is not wasted.
str_battle_won_sadistic|Now let us strip their dead and leave them for the crows, so that all will know the fate of those who come against us.
str_battle_won_goodnatured|That was a good scrap! No joy like the joy of victory, eh?
str_battle_won_upstanding|Now, let us give thanks to the heavens for our victory, and mourn the many fine men who have fallen today.
str_battle_won_grudging_default|You helped turn the tide on the field, today. Whatever I may think of you, I cannot fault you for your valor.
str_battle_won_grudging_martial|{playername} -- you have shown yourself a worthy {man/woman} today, whatever your misdeeds in the past.
str_battle_won_grudging_quarrelsome|Hmf. Yours is not a face which I normally like to see, but I suppose today I should thank you for your help.
str_battle_won_grudging_pitiless|Your help was most valuable today. I would not imagine that you came to help me out of kindness, but I nonetheless thank you.
str_battle_won_grudging_cunning|It would be unwise of me not to thank you for coming to help me in my hour of need. So... You have my gratitude.
str_battle_won_grudging_sadistic|Well! How touching! {playername} has come to rescue me.
str_battle_won_grudging_goodnatured|{playername}! I can't say that we've always gotten along in the past, but you fought well today. My thanks to you!
str_battle_won_grudging_upstanding|Perhaps I was wrong about you. Your arrival was most timely. You have my gratitude.
str_battle_won_unfriendly_default|So you're here. Well, better late than never, I suppose.
str_battle_won_unfriendly_martial|We have hard harsh words in the past, but for now let us simply enjoy our victory.
str_battle_won_unfriendly_quarrelsome|If you're standing there waiting for thanks, you can keep waiting. Your help wasn't really needed, but I guess you had nothing better to do, right?
str_battle_won_unfriendly_pitiless|You have come here, like a jackal to a lion's kill. Very well then, help yourself to the spoils. I shall not stop you.
str_battle_won_unfriendly_cunning|{playername}... Well, I suppose your arrival didn't hurt, although I won't pretend that I'm happy to see you.
str_battle_won_unfriendly_sadistic|Back off, carrion fowl! This was my victory, however hard you try to steal the glory for yourself.
str_battle_won_unfriendly_goodnatured|Oh, it's you. Well, I suppose I should thank you for your help.
str_battle_won_unfriendly_upstanding|Thank you for coming to my support. Now I will be off, before I say something that I regret.
str_troop_train_request_default|I need someone like you to knock them into shape.
str_troop_train_request_martial|They need someone to show them the meaning of valor.
str_troop_train_request_quarrelsome|Fat lazy bastards. They make me puke.
str_troop_train_request_pitiless|They are more afraid of the enemy than they are of me, and this will not do.
str_troop_train_request_cunning|But men, like swords, are tempered and hardened by fire.
str_troop_train_request_sadistic|They need someone with steel in his back to flog some courage into them, or kill them trying.
str_troop_train_request_goodnatured|They're good enough lads, but I am afraid that they are not quite ready for a battle just yet.
str_troop_train_request_upstanding|It would be tantamount to murder for me to lead them into combat in their current state.
str_unprovoked_attack_default|What? Why do you attack us? Speak, you rascal!
str_unprovoked_attack_martial|I have no objection to a trial of arms, but I would ask you for what reason you attack us?
str_unprovoked_attack_quarrelsome|You're making a big mistake, {reg33?girl:boy}. What do you think you're doing?
str_unprovoked_attack_pitiless|Indeed? If you really want to die today, I'd be more than happy to oblige you, but I am curious as to what you hope to accomplish.
str_unprovoked_attack_cunning|Really? I think that you are acting most unwisely. What do you hope to gain by this?
str_unprovoked_attack_sadistic|What's this? Do you enjoy having your eyes put out?
str_unprovoked_attack_goodnatured|Why do you do this? We've got no quarrel, {reg33?madame:sir}.
str_unprovoked_attack_upstanding|I consider this an unprovoked assault, and will protest to your king. Why do you do this?
str_unnecessary_attack_default|I will not hesitate to cut you down if pressed, but I will offer you the chance to ride away from this.
str_unnecessary_attack_martial|I am eager to take you up on your challenge, {reg33?madame:sir}, although I will give you a minute to reconsider.
str_unnecessary_attack_quarrelsome|Bah! I'm in no mood for this nonsense today. Get out of my way.
str_unnecessary_attack_pitiless|I am in a merciful mood today. I will pretend that I did not hear you.
str_unnecessary_attack_cunning|I don't see what you have to gain by making an enemy of me. Maybe you should just ride away.
str_unnecessary_attack_sadistic|I have no time to waste on a worm like you. Get out of my way.
str_unnecessary_attack_goodnatured|I don't see what you have to gain by picking a fight, {reg33?madame:sir}. You can still ride away.
str_unnecessary_attack_upstanding|If a fight is what you wish, {reg33?madame:sir}, then you will have one, but I will yet offer you the chance to back down.
str_lord_challenged_default|As you wish. Prepare to die!
str_lord_challenged_martial|So be it. Defend yourself!
str_lord_challenged_quarrelsome|You impudent whelp! I'll crush you!
str_lord_challenged_pitiless|If you so badly wish to die, then I have no choice but to oblige you.
str_lord_challenged_cunning|Well, if you leave me no choice...
str_lord_challenged_sadistic|You heap of filth! I'll make you wish you'd never been born.
str_lord_challenged_goodnatured|Very well. I had hoped that we might avoid coming to blows, but I see that have no choice.
str_lord_challenged_upstanding|So be it. It saddens me that you cannot be made to see reason.
str_lord_mission_failed_default|Well, I am disappointed, but I am sure that you will have many chances to redeem yourself.
str_lord_mission_failed_martial|There is no honour in failing a quest which you endeavoured to take, but I will accept your word on it.
str_lord_mission_failed_quarrelsome|You failed? Bah. I should have expected as much from the likes of you.
str_lord_mission_failed_pitiless|You failed? Well. You disappoint me. That is a most unwise thing to do.
str_lord_mission_failed_cunning|Well, I am disappointed, but no one can guarantee that the winds of fortune will always blow their way.
str_lord_mission_failed_sadistic|Indeed? Those who fail me do not always live to regret it.
str_lord_mission_failed_goodnatured|Oh well. It was a long shot, anyway. Thank you for making an effort.
str_lord_mission_failed_upstanding|Very well. I am sure that you gave it your best effort.
str_lord_follow_refusal_default|Follow you? You forget your station, {reg33?madame:sir}.
str_lord_follow_refusal_martial|Perhaps if you one day prove yourself a valorous and honourable warrior, then I would follow you. But not today.
str_lord_follow_refusal_quarrelsome|Follow someone like you? I don't think so.
str_lord_follow_refusal_pitiless|Lords like me do not follow people like you, {reg33?madame:sir}.
str_lord_follow_refusal_cunning|First show me that you are the type of {reg33?woman:man} who will not lead me into disaster, and then perhaps I will follow you.
str_lord_follow_refusal_sadistic|I think not! Rather, you should follow me, as a whipped cur follows {reg33?her:his} master.
str_lord_follow_refusal_goodnatured|Um, I am a bit pressed with errands right now. Perhaps at a later date.
str_lord_follow_refusal_upstanding|First show me that you are worthy to lead, and then perhaps I will follow.

str_rebellion_dilemma_martial|{s45} was clearly wronged. Although I gave an oath to {s46}, it does not bind me to support him if he usurped his throne illegally.
str_rebellion_dilemma_quarrelsome|Hmm. {s46} has never given me my due, so I don't figure I owe him much. However, maybe {s45} will be no better, and {s46} has at least shown himself .
str_rebellion_dilemma_pitiless|Hmm. {s45} says {reg3?she:he} is the rightful heir to the throne. That is good -- it absolves me of my oath to {s46}. But still I must weight my decision carefully.
str_rebellion_dilemma_cunning|Hmm. I gave an oath of homage to {s46}, yet the powerful are not bound by their oaths as our ordinary people. Our duty is to our own ability to rule, to impose order and prevent the war of all against all.
str_rebellion_dilemma_sadistic|Hmm. In this vile world, a wise man must think of himself, for no one else will. So -- what's in it for me?
str_rebellion_dilemma_goodnatured|I do not know what to say. I gave an oath to {s46} as the lawful ruler, but if he is not the lawful ruler, I don't know if I am still bound.
str_rebellion_dilemma_upstanding|This is troublesome. It is a grave thing to declare my homage to {s46} to be null and void, and dissolve the bonds which keep our land from sinking into anarchy. Yet I am also pledged to support the legitimacy of the succession, and {s45} also has a valid claim to the throne.
str_rebellion_dilemma_2_martial|On the other hand, {s46} has led us in war and peace, and I am loathe to renounce my allegiance.
str_rebellion_dilemma_2_quarrelsome|So tell me, why should I turn my back on the bastard I know, in favor of {reg3?a woman:the bastard} I don't know?
str_rebellion_dilemma_2_pitiless|It is a most perilous position to be in, to be asked whom I would make {reg3?ruler:king} of this land. Yet it is also a time of opportunity, for me to reap the rewards that have always been my due!
str_rebellion_dilemma_2_cunning|{s46} has been challenged, and thus he will never be able to rule as strongly as one whose claim has never been questioned. Yet if {s45} takes the throne by force, {reg3?she:he} will not be as strong as one who succeeded peacefully.
str_rebellion_dilemma_2_sadistic|Perhaps if I join {s45} while {reg3?she:he} is still weak {reg3?she:he} will enrich me, but perhaps if I bring {s46} your head he will give me an even greater reward.
str_rebellion_dilemma_2_goodnatured|{s46} has always treated me decently, yet it's true that he did wrong to {s45}. I hesitate to renounce my homage to {s46}, yet I also don't think it's right to support injustice.
str_rebellion_dilemma_2_upstanding|I feel that I must do whatever is best for the realm, to avoid it being laid waste by civil war and ravaged by its enemies.
str_political_philosophy_martial|My sword is at the disposal of my rightful liege, so long as he upholds his duty to me.
str_political_philosophy_quarrelsome|Bah. They're all a bunch of bastards. I try to make sure that the ones who wrong me learn to regret it.
str_political_philosophy_pitiless|Men will always try to cheat others of their rightful due. In this faithless world, each must remain vigilant of his own rights.
str_political_philosophy_cunning|Well, it's a harsh world, and it is our lot to face harsh choices. Sometimes one must serve a tyrant to keep the peace, but sometimes a bit of rebellion keeps the kings honest. Circumstance is all.
str_political_philosophy_sadistic|My philosophy is simple: it is better to be the wolf than the lamb.
str_political_philosophy_goodnatured|Well, you should keep faith with your promises, and not do injustice to others. Sometimes it's hard to balance those. Stick with people you trust, I think, and it's hard to go far wrong.
str_political_philosophy_upstanding|Kingship and lordship have been instituted to keep the peace and prevent the war of all against all, yet that must not blind us to the possibility of injustice.
str_political_philosophy_roguish|Hmm.. I guess I'm thinking that it's good to be a lord.
str_political_philosophy_benefactor|A good ruler makes sure all are treated justly. Personally, I intend to use my authority to better the lot of those who live in my demesne.
str_political_philosophy_custodian|A good ruler creates the proper conditions for people to prosper. Personally, I intend to use my wealth to create more wealth, for myself and for the common benefit.

str_rebellion_rival_martial|{s49} your ally {s44} once questioned my honour and my bravery. It's not often I get the chance to face him in battle, and make him retract his statement.
str_rebellion_rival_quarrelsome|{s49} you're working with {s44}. He's a crafty weasel, and I don't trust him one bit.
str_rebellion_rival_pitiless|{s49} you seem to have enlisted the support of {s44} -- who is soft, and weak, and not fit to govern a fief, and whom I have always detested.
str_rebellion_rival_cunning|{s49} {s44}, who has already joined you, is headstrong and quarrelsome, and a bit of liability.
str_rebellion_rival_sadistic|{s49} I have no desire to fight alongside your ally {s44}, who puts on such a nauseating display of virtue.
str_rebellion_rival_goodnatured|{s49} I'd be reluctant to be on the same side as {s44}, who has quite a reputation for cruelty.
str_rebellion_rival_upstanding|{s49} your ally {s44} is in my opinion a dangerous, unreliable, and highly unprincipled man.

str_rebellion_agree_martial|I have decided. I will back {s45} as the rightful heir.
str_rebellion_agree_quarrelsome|Ahh, I've thought long enough. I never did like {s46} much anyway. Let's go take his throne away from him.
str_rebellion_agree_pitiless|You are fortunate. I have decided to join you. Pray do not give me cause to regret this decision.
str_rebellion_agree_cunning|This is a most dangerous decision, but after careful consideration, I have decided that I will join you. Let's hope it is for the best.
str_rebellion_agree_sadistic|I have decided. I will back your {reg3?woman:man} {s45}. But you'd best make sure that {reg3?she:he} rewards me well!
str_rebellion_agree_goodnatured|All right. I think your {reg3?woman:man} will be a good ruler. I'll join you.
str_rebellion_agree_upstanding|So be it. My first duty is to this realm, and to save it from lawlessness I will back {s45} and renounce my homage to {s46}. May the Heavens forgive me if I do wrong.
str_rebellion_refuse_martial|I am sorry. {s45} has a good claim, but it's not enough for me to turn my back on {s46}. I will remain loyal to my liege.
str_rebellion_refuse_quarrelsome|Nah. Your whelp {s45} doesn't have what it takes to rule this realm. I'm sticking with {s46}.
str_rebellion_refuse_pitiless|No. I will not join your rebellion. I count it little more than the tantrum of a child, denied a bauble which {reg3?she:he} thinks should be {reg3?hers:his}. I will stick with {s46}, whose ability to rule is well-tested.
str_rebellion_refuse_cunning|I am sorry. You do not give me reason for confidence that you will win. Many will die, but I do not wish to be among them. I will continue to back {s46}.
str_rebellion_refuse_sadistic|No. I won't play your little game. You grasp at a crown, but I think instead you'll get a quick trip to the scaffold, and I'll be there by {s46}'s side to watch the headsman's axe drop.
str_rebellion_refuse_goodnatured|I am sorry. I don't feel right turning my back on {s46}. No hard feelings when me meet on the battlefield.
str_rebellion_refuse_upstanding|I am sorry. {s45}'s claim is not strong enough for me to inflict the curse of civil disorder on the poor wretches of this land. I will continue to back {s46}. May the Heavens forgive me if I do wrong.
str_talk_later_martial|Now is not the time to talk politics! I am here today with my fellow lords, armed for battle. You'd better prepare to fight.
str_talk_later_quarrelsome|Do you expect me to discuss betraying my liege with you, while we are surrounded by his army? What do you take me for, a bloody idiot?
str_talk_later_pitiless|Still your tongue! Whatever I have to say on this matter, I will not say it here and now, while we are in the midst of our army.
str_talk_later_cunning|This is hardly the time or the place for such a discussion. Perhaps we can discuss it at a later time and a different place, but for now we're still foes.
str_talk_later_sadistic|You should have your mouth sewn shut! Can you imagine what would happen if the other vassals see me talking to you of treason?
str_talk_later_goodnatured|So you wish to discuss your rebellion with me? Try that again when we aren't surrounded by my liege's army, and I will hear what you have to say.
str_talk_later_upstanding|Whatever my thoughts on the legitimacy of the succession, I am not about to discuss them here and now. If we meet again when we can talk in privacy, I will hear what you have to say on the matter. But for now, consider me your enemy.

str_gossip_about_character_martial|They say that {s6} loves nothing more than war.

str_nord_rebellion_pretender_story_1|I am the leader of the New Gods followers of Maccavia. For many years, tensions in Maccavia have been building. The Old Gods followers still have barbaric ways and are uncivilised. We, the New Gods followers, turn to chivalry, honor, and justice instead of glory, fame and battle. Our goal is to protect the innocent people and help those in need, not to cast them down, like Agathor has done.
str_rhodok_rebellion_pretender_story_1|We have been fighting against Queen Arwen for a long time. She is not the rightful ruler, as we have discovered long ago. She has lied and deceived her way to the highest position. But no, not everything is as it seems. When I was a young lord, I was brash, and the Queen, who was only another lady at the time, loved me. We became very close, and I believed that one day we would marry and have a good life.
str_sarranid_rebellion_pretender_story_1|I am the daughter of the former emperor, Emperor Comrey. I was going to be the next ruler of the Hakkon Empire, but as soon as our ships landed on Perisnoan soil, Emperor Hakkon II had his men take me prisoner and throw me into a dungeon. Fortunately, I also have allies, and my loyal followers broke me out of prison. Emperor Hakkon II continued his search for me, and when he did not find me, ignore me.
str_swadian_rebellion_pretender_story_2|Torlian has ignored the dictates of our founders, and instead chooses to rule the country in his own tyrannical way. I tried to stop him -- many times, but with the military backing him, there is little I can do. Torlian rules Tolrania with an iron fist. My brother does what he can, but it is not enough. Anyway, let me continue my tale. I was the daughter of a farmer, and my mother died during childbirth. I rose up the ranks through the freeborn in my teenage years.
str_vaegir_rebellion_pretender_story_2|I was born in the Reich homeland, the Isle of the Dragon, where all of my generation come from. Otto was only a general in our homeland, but he was the one selected to lead the Drache here and rule. However, he has done poorly and we have not conquered as many territories as we should. I believe that I, the leader of the mighty Church of the Dragon and holder of all of its secrets, should be the one leading the Reich towards glory.
str_khergit_rebellion_pretender_story_2|I was the son of the previous Sultan, and by all rights I should have become the Sultan. But Yusuf, a nobody, managed to gain control of an entire nation by his words! He is not even of noble line, I think. He should not be the ruler of Drahara. He has comitted many atrocities in war and have wronged me. He has this idea that the West should be conquered by the Draharan tribes, and that Drahara is the superior nation of them all.
str_nord_rebellion_pretender_story_2|Agathor and his followers are foolish and stubborn. They do not adapt quickly to change, and that is the thing that will destroy them. Their foolish religion and gods have never helped them, unlike our Gods who have helped us many times. If I am the king of Maccavia, I will swear to uphold justice and help those in need. Agathor is a tyrant that must be put down.
str_rhodok_rebellion_pretender_story_2|However, it turns out that she only wanted to marry me to elevate her position. She got what she wanted, and I got nothing. She then used my money to bribe lords to join her cause, and she campaigned to become the next Queen. A few months later, the entire Elintor noble family was assassinated by Ral'Daiun assassins, but when I tortured one of them, they told me it was Arwen who had organized it.
str_sarranid_rebellion_pretender_story_2|It was the worst decision he ever made. For his ten years as ruler, I have plagued him and spread word of who the actual ruler is. Hakkon II has lied and deceived his way to his current position. He has failed to follow traditional Hakkonese customs and done everything in a new way, which is unacceptable. If he is to run this country any longer that he has already, the Hakkon Empire will break apart under poor leadership.
str_swadian_rebellion_pretender_story_3|I quickly became leader of the Free Men, with my brother acting as the strength behind us. We have been fighting a long and bloody war with Torlian for years but to no avail. But no matter -- I will raise an army sooner or later to wipe that man off the face of the earth! He has no right to rule this country, and took it through force. Tolrania should be a republic, and not follow the footsteps of our ancestors, the cursed Hakkon Empire.
str_vaegir_rebellion_pretender_story_3|I will not stop until I control the Reich. We should not be divided by this way. The Church is much more powerful and wealthier than Otto can ever hope to be.
str_khergit_rebellion_pretender_story_3|So now, I remain in exile. All I can do is wait for the people to change their minds, and decide that Yusuf is truly not what he seems. I hope that day will come soon.
str_nord_rebellion_pretender_story_3|The only thing stopping Maccavia from erupting to a civil war are those cursed Drachens and Tolranians. A nation must act as one in times as this, and this is exactly what Agathor is not doing. If Agathor truly believes he can rule, then let him say so face to face with me, as we battle it out lance to axe.
str_rhodok_rebellion_pretender_story_3|Arwen has denied these claims and exiled all of the opposition from the country. Most, fearing they would be next to die, did not speak out against the Queen and now these events are long forgotten. But not by me. I will never forget, and I will never forgive, until I see Queen Arwen dead!
str_sarranid_rebellion_pretender_story_3|I have been gathering a loyal army, and soon, I will be able to strike back against Hakkon. When I do so, he better be ready, because he will not dare to face my wrath. 
str_swadian_rebellion_monarch_response_1|Tylora seems to be awfully sure of herself. Her army is fighting a losing war, her resources are dwindling, and she is losing support. She thinks that she should be the leader of a 'Free Perisno!' What a joke! Tolrania has prospered under my rule, and it could not have done if Tylora was the ruler. Her ideas of a republic are foolish and impossible.
str_vaegir_rebellion_monarch_response_1|The foolish man, Exladimus, believes that his Church is almighty and powerful and thinks that just because his men share a bond with the Dragons, he is the rightful ruler.
str_khergit_rebellion_monarch_response_1|I will tell you something. It is true I come from a commoner family, but Draharans value leaders by skill and heart, not by blood! Qalawun thinks he is the rightful leader of the Draharan tribes, but he forgets one thing. The Draharans would not even be a nation without me!
str_nord_rebellion_monarch_response_1|Dracchus is a fool trying to ruin this nation. He seems to have a problem with our religion. We have done nothing wrong, and believed in the traditional Gods of Maccavia. He takes it one step further, making a new religion as if he were some prophet, and decides that his is purer. The only reason he believes in the New Gods is to make it an excuse to oppose me.
str_rhodok_rebellion_monarch_response_1|Did Aethlindil tell you that I lied my way to the throne? That I bribed and deceived and who knows what else? He is very wrong. He is jealous of my power, jealous of me and how I have managed to rise to the throne while he is still a lowly rebel lord. He and his group spread lies about me everywhere they go, whispering poison into other people's ears.
str_sarranid_rebellion_monarch_response_1|It is true that I locked up Aris once we landed on Perisnoan soil. But it is not without reason. I did so to prevent the kingdom from erupting into a civil war. Aris is the daughter of King Comrey, who is a mad king and is the reason of the Tolranian's migration and ours. We left the Hakkon island to escape the Regime of Comrey, Aris's father.
str_swadian_rebellion_monarch_response_2|The people who stir up trouble are all outlaws and bandits, like Tylora's brother himself, Nibor Hood. He claims to be honorable but steals from anyone passing through and demands a toll! Giving to the poor, he says! Well, the poor are still poor! I see no changes all these long years. No, Nibor does what he does only for greed. Tylora and her brother are only flies to be swatted.
str_vaegir_rebellion_monarch_response_2|The Dragon Priest would do anything to gain power. He spreads lies about me and preaches garbage to everyone else, and because of that he thinks he is the rightful ruler! He claims he is far wealthier than me, but where is his proof? He had to borrow money from me some time ago, as I recall. He is a fool.
str_khergit_rebellion_monarch_response_2|Drahara was formed recently, and I was the one to do it. I united the desert tribes and made us into a nation. Qalawun only thinks he should be Sultan because he is the son of the most influential tribe leader. He has no claim to the throne, unlike me, who was chosen to rule by all the tribes unanimously.
str_nord_rebellion_monarch_response_2|He cares nothing about his Gods either. He only cares about power. He thinks that the New Gods will help him achieve it, and uses them as an excuse to justify everything he does. It is he who would truly like to see the downfall of Maccavia, and I fear one day he will through his foolish acts.
str_rhodok_rebellion_monarch_response_2|Aethlindil says that I committed atrocities to gain the throne. Let's see, what war crimes is he responsible for? I can name many. The massacre of Lille is one. Another is the torture of my Elintoran Elites and the burning of my generals. Aethlindil is no purer than you or me.
str_sarranid_rebellion_monarch_response_2|Aris seems to share her father's madness. I cannot have someone as wretched and detestable as her leading our great empire. She may say what she will about me, but it changes nothing. She is still the crazy little daughter of King Comrey, and the one who will bring the downfall of Hakkon should she be given the chance.

str_feast_lengthy_description_1|The food you provided was insufficient for your guests and their retinues, forcing them to purchase their sustenance from the surrounding countryside at grossly inflated prices. The consensus among those who attended was that you failed to do your duty as a host, diminishing both their trust in you and your overall reputation.
str_feast_lengthy_description_2|The food and drink you provided eventually ran out, forcing some guests to either buy their own from passing peddlars, or send some of their retinue home early. The more charitable attributed the shortfall to poor planning rather than meanness, but either way, it did your reputation no good.
str_feast_lengthy_description_3|The food and drink you provided was adequate for your noble guests, although some of the commoners in their retinues went without. You are establishing a reputation as one who has at least a grasp of your social obligations as a noble.
str_feast_lengthy_description_4|You have provided enough food and drink, and with sufficient varieties, to do yourself credit. The food, drink, and merriment have loosened your guests tongues, allowing them to converse candidly about the matters of the realm, and deepening their trust in you.
str_feast_lengthy_description_5|You have provided a bountiful table not just for your noble guests but for their retinues, with food left over to be distributed to the poor. Your guests lavish praise upon you for your generosity, and for your understanding of the social obligations of your rank. The conversation, fueled by the food and drink, has been merry, strengthening the bonds between those who attended.
str_feast_lengthy_description_6|The realm will be speaking of the bounty of your table for months to come, and it will become the standard to which all other feasts will aspire. You have filled the bellies not just of your noble guests and their retinues, but also of the poor who flocked to the gates.

Nervous looking young men are waiting in every street corner. You can see they have daggers and clubs concealed under their clothes, and catch a mixture of fear, anticipation and pride in the quick looks they throw at you as you pass by. Praying that your enemies have not been alarmed by this all too obvious bunch of plotters, you check your weapons for one last time and prepare yourself for the action ahead.
str_town_fight_ended_you_and_citizens_cleaned_town_from_bandits|The remaining few bandits scatter off to the town's narrow alleys, only to be hunted down one by one by the angry townsfolk.

Soon the sounds of fighting filling the street gives way to the cheers of the townsmen and you realize with relief that your side won the day. Soon, friendly arms pick you up from the ground and you let yourself drift off to a blissful sleep. Hours later, you wake up in the merchants house.
str_journey_to_reyvadin|You have come through the Drache highlands, a plateau exposed to the bitter winds from the north. The land here is frozen for most of the year, but the forests are rich with fur-bearing game, and the rivers are teaming with fish. The riches of the land draw the traders, but the traders in turn draw bandits. You saw the occasional dark figure mounted on a shaggy pony, watching the passage of your caravan from a snowy ridge, and were glad when the spires of Murdenholl came into view across the wide valley of the Boluk river. This lands is mysterious as the stories tell of a dragon once seen in the sky, though no one can be sure if this is just a myth
str_journey_to_praven|You came by caravan through the heartland of Perisno. Green shoots of wheat, barley and oats are beginning to push through the dark soil of the rolling hills, and on the lower slopes of the snowcapped mountains, herds of cattle and sheep are grazing on the spring grass.  The land here is rich -- but also troubled, as the occasional burnt-out farm bears witness. You keep a wide berth of the forests, where desperate men have taken refuge, and it is some relief when you crest a ridge and catch sight of the great port of Lesbere, its rooftops made golden by the last rays of the setting sun.
str_journey_to_jelkala|You came by ship, skirting the cliffs where the Elven woodlands meet the sea. Much of the coastline was obscured by tendrils of fog that snaked down the river valleys, but occasionally you caught sight of a castle watchtower rising above the mists -- and on one occasion, a beacon fire burning to warn of an enemy warband. You knew that you were relatively safe at sea, as you were too far south to risk encountering the sea pirates who trouble the coasts of the Maccavian lands, but it was still a relief to reach the Selver estuary, gateway to the port of Forniron, and see a Elven war boat riding at anchor, its pennants fluttering in the evening breeze.
str_journey_to_sargoth|You took passage with a trading longship, carrying gyrfalcons from the furthest reaches of the north to be bartered for linen and wool. It sailed early in the season, but the master reckoned that the risks of drifting ice and later winter storms could be justified by arriving ahead of the Volheere, who by April would be sailing forth from their island lairs to ravage Perinso's coasts. It was some relief when your ship came in sight of the delta of the Vyl and Boluk rivers, and a short while later, rowed past tidal flats and coastal marshes to the city of Maccan, home to the Volheere' distant kinsmen, the Maccavian lords, who a few generations ago had carved themselves a kingdom in this rich but troubled land.
str_journey_to_tulga|You came with a caravan, crossing the mountains that border Perisno on the north and east, bringing spices from faraway lands to trade for wool and salt. The passes were still choked with snow, and it was hard going, but at last you crested a ridge and saw before you the great Perisno steppes. On some hillsides the thin grass of spring was already turning yellow, but the lower slopes of the mountains were still a vibrant green. Herds of sheep and tawny steppe ponies drifted across them like clouds, testifying to the wealth of the Drahara khans. From time to time small groups of horsemen would follow your caravan from a distance, perhaps sizing up how well you could defend the wealth you carried, so it was with some relief that you saw the towers of Khul Vara rising up from the plains.
str_journey_to_shariz|You came with a caravan, crossing the great desert to the east of Perisno. The bedouin guides chose your route carefully, leapfrogging through treacherous dune fields and across empty gravel plains to low-lying oases rich with orchards and date palms. Your great fear was that the caravan might lose its way and perish of thirst. The small bands of raiders who hovered just out of bowshot, waiting to pick off stragglers, were oddly a comfort -- at least water could be no more than a day's ride away. It was a great relief when the mountains came into view, and on the evening of the following day you crested a rocky pass and in the distance could make out the sea, and the towers of Amarna silhouetted against the sunset.
str_lost_tavern_duel_ordinary|You slump to the floor, stunned by the drunk's last blow. Your attacker's rage immediately seems to slacken. He drops into a chair and sits there watching you, muttering under his breath, almost regretfully. A few of the other patrons manage to coax him to his feet and bundle him out the door.

But before he can finish you off, the tavernkeeper, who seems to have regained his courage, comes up from behind and gives your attacker a clout behind the head. He loses his balance, and then, seeing that his chance to kill you has been lost, makes a dash for the door. He gets away. Meanwhile, the other tavern patrons bind your wounds and haul you to a back room to rest and recover.

str_meet_weapons_enthusiast|Meet up with the Weapons Enthusiast in Forde and tell him of your success.
str_generic_rumor_1|I heard that the Tower of Tolranus is really quite the structure. Amazing, what people can make these days with enough time and money on their hands.
str_generic_rumor_2|Some day I would love to venture out to the far reaches of the land. The snowy mountains of Nisaynia are rich with other cultures that are just begging to be explored.
str_generic_rumor_3|A Volheere man approached me a few days ago and asked me if I knew where they made ale. I told him I didn't know, and he wandered off, shaking his head. A strange folk, the Volheerians.
str_generic_rumor_4|You know, I heard that a distant empire called the Klyrintin Empire was sending a fleet over to Perisno to explore. It is said these Klyrintins have amazing discipline. I do not believe it though.
str_generic_rumor_5|I have heard that the Reich des Drachen came from a land full of mysterious and unusual creatures. Imagine what it would be like to see these animals with your own eyes...
str_generic_rumor_6|I heard that a band of men called the Red Immortals from the Old Hakkon empire are in Perisno. You might want to ask a man in Grund, though. It was he who told me.
str_generic_rumor_7|My friend was a Tolranian spy and worked in the field in the forest of the Elintorans. He was always amazed by their skills and claimed that in a training excercise one elf hit the bullseye on a target 14 times in a row.
str_generic_rumor_8|One of my contacts recently asked me if I knew anything about something called the Kingslayer sword. He said he was searching for it.
str_generic_rumor_9|I heard a rumor that a man called Ulfhednar was landing on the shores of Perisno with a mighty host of Volheere berserkers to wreak havoc upon the land. As if we did not have enough on our hands already!
str_generic_rumor_10|I heard that the Demon Worshippers were gathering an army because of some unknown reasons. Let us hope they never succeed in whatever they are planning.
str_generic_rumor_11|The men of the Valahir Clan are supposed to be some of the fiercest and relentless warriors in all the lands of Perisno. Their mastery of the way of the axe is unparalelled.
str_generic_rumor_12|A traveler recently came to me and talked to me about an empire called the Klyrintin, over in the distant shores. He said that they were interested in exploring, and were heading to Perisno.
str_generic_rumor_13|The constant wars of Perisno have made its populace one of the most resilient in all of the lands. That said, there is only so much conflict one can stand in a life.
str_generic_rumor_14|You know, I heard that the Great Bard Taragith is staying in Amarna right now. Who knows, maybe we can catch sight of him in the tavern!
str_generic_rumor_15|I met a man who called himself a 'Republic Scholar' at the great library of Galwe. He said he was trying to find answers to a new form of government, called a Republic. How interesting, don't you think?
str_generic_rumor_16|On an journey across Draharan lands I came across a band of men riding massive beasts with white swords protruding from either side of their mouths. Had I not been riding my trusty steed Rekin, they just may have caught me.
str_generic_rumor_17|I do not have any rumors to tell but do you know the history of the Hakkon and Tolranians? They say the Tolranians were once Hakkonese but broke away and sailed to Perisno. Interesting stuff, huh?
str_generic_rumor_18|I heard about someone called the Invincible knight. Said that he was the finest weapons master in this land and could defeat anyone. I wonder ...
str_generic_rumor_19|I heard that the savage Volheere eat the corpses of dead men. Imagine that ... or rather, don't imagine that! How horrible. Watch yourself when you fight them.
str_generic_rumor_20|Many people claim to have seen mysterious creatures riding around the lands of the Reich des Drachen. I for one think these people have lost their marbles.
str_generic_rumor_21|A man came to me and told me about the supposed place where the Reich des Drachen comes from - the Isle of the Dragon. They say that exotic creatures roam there. I would love to see one.
str_generic_rumor_22|It is said that the Amazons kill any male babies that they have or make them slaves. How horrible, don't you think?
str_generic_rumor_23|I saw it happen, one day long, long ago. A fleet of ships carrying a strange banner of Nisaynia wrecked on the coast of Reich lands. Hundreds of men swarmed out of these ships, eager to raid and pillage anything in their paths.
str_generic_rumor_24|A friend of mine, a scholar from the University of Galwe, told me that they were making breakthroughs on studying ancient artifacts and weapons. I don't get the point of history...
str_generic_rumor_25|While I was traveling, a group of bandits ambushed me. Suddenly, a group of Glory-Seeking Men came to my rescue and drove them away. I love how they keep these lands safe.
str_generic_rumor_26|While I was traveling, I was accosted by a group of Eagle Knights. The only thing that saved me from being killed from them were a group of Demon Worshippers that ambushed them. The irony!
str_generic_rumor_27|I owe my life to the great Sultan Yusuf Al-Salah. A band of Deskouk Slavers were closing in on me and about to capture me when he rode in and scared them off with his fearsome Garudas.
str_generic_rumor_28|A colleague of mine told me that a group of Hakkon inquisitors put a lord on trial and killed him. Then they stripped him of his lands and titles and took them for their own.
str_generic_rumor_29|An associate of mine told me that there was a man called the Mythseeker who was crazy. It is said he searches endlessly for myths and tries to prove them to be fact. The scholars of Galwe would definitely disapprove!
str_generic_rumor_30|I am a firm beliver in the practices of the New Gods. Unlike the violent Old Gods, they honor values such as peace, chivalry, grace, and family coherence.
str_generic_rumor_31|The New Gods are nothing but peace-loving hooligans who know nothing of the true nature of life. The Old Gods are right in honoring war and strength over peace.
str_generic_rumor_32|There is nothing like the thundering drum of hooves on the earth and the metallic uproar of steel hitting steel to make a man feel alive
str_generic_rumor_33|I always love being in a town whilst a tournament is going on. Even though it scarcely happens, feeling you get when your man fights his way through every last round of the tournament is euphoric.
str_generic_rumor_34|Sometimes when I am bored I will travel to Galwe and pick out a few books an Ancient Perisnoan History. It fascinates me how much Perisno has changed since the rule of the Perisnoan Empire.
str_generic_rumor_35|The best part of traveling in Perisno is sailing to the Valahir lands. The air is always crisp with a soft and cool edge, and the vast expanses of water give an impression of solitude that is hard to come by on the mainland.
str_tolrania_rumor_1|It breaks my heart to see my babies go out to fight. We are at war so often, I hope those cursed Elves go to hell! They have no business here.
str_tolrania_rumor_2|I am still aghast by the treachery of the Hakkons that took place so long ago. No wonder Captain Otto Waveshore decided to flee.
str_tolrania_rumor_3|I heard a story recently from a wandering bard about a foreign empire called the Klyrintin Empire. What utter nonsense!
str_tolrania_rumor_4|Our family history is rooted within the walls of this city. Tolrania runs in our blood, and we are proud to call it our home!
str_tolrania_rumor_5|My brave son, Ralim, fought in the War of the Woods. He is now sick and dying still scarred from his battle wounds, with no one to care for him. My brave, brave son.
str_tolrania_rumor_6|My brother Nemol is due to return from a a recent Tolranian campaign any day now. We have all awaited this moment since our men stepped foot outside the gates of this city!
str_tolrania_rumor_7|The Tower of Tolranus ... t'is a wonderful landmark. I visited it recently, and it bears no mark of age! Truly a wonder ...
str_tolrania_rumor_8|Stay away from elves, stranger. I heard from a wise man that they are savage barbarians with no sense of morality. They are unnatural.
str_tolrania_rumor_9|There is no feeling quite the same as the sense of security brought forth by these big, strong walls and our loyal guardsmen. We should all be grateful that we have such a thing.
str_tolrania_rumor_10|There is word going around the tavern that Lord Haglar Malin is coming to visit in a few days. I for one think the talk is a load of rubbish.
str_tolrania_rumor_11|The brave Tolranian Kingsmen ... they are a true symbol of honor to our great nation. I heard that one of them managed to defeat four elven rangers, in one to one combat!
str_tolrania_rumor_12|Wars ... neverending wars. I believe that someone should step up for once and call and end to all this bloodshed! The pen is mightier than the sword, I tell you!
str_tolrania_rumor_13|Those damned forest bandits ... especially that Nibor Hood! He is a hypocrite! He robbed me of my son and my possessions! Hopefully the nobles can see him hanged.
str_tolrania_rumor_14|The local patrols have had a hard time dealing with the local outlaws...they seem to be multiplying faster than they can be slain!
str_tolrania_rumor_15|That man ... Nibor Hood. He is a true symbol of justice - a ... a freedom fighter! The Tolranian government is corupt. I hope he will succeed one day!
str_tolrania_rumor_16|Many people have expressed a desire for a tavern renovation. The problem is, the current tavern has become a part of this town's legacy; only a fool would destroy such a place full of history
str_tolrania_rumor_17|Say, have you heard of a strange group of people called the Monks of Tagair? It is said they do nothing but chronicle the lives of famous men, all day and night!
str_tolrania_rumor_18|A shady character talked to me a few days ago... said he wanted to know something about a man called the Mythseeker. How strange...
str_tolrania_rumor_19|There was a man called Karkar who approached me a few days ago. Said he wanted to sketch the city. That's something, eh?
