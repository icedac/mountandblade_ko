qstr_This_area_of_{s1}_ca|This area of {s1} can best be described as the very core of the town.^^ You can almost see the strings that are being pulled from here, the money that comes and goes at seemingly endless rates.  Here you can buy the land that is cultivated outside the towns gates and benefit from the ones working hard. Of course you might not have the aurums required to do so, but the moneylenders are known to have some spare change.
qstr_{reg1}_people_live_i|{reg1} people live in {s1}. There are currently {reg2} acres of land available for cultivation to provide them with  food and other goods. You own {reg3} acres of land in this town. You currently owe the moneylenders of {s1} {reg4} aurums. The interest rate is 20% and the contract period amounts  to 2 weeks. If you dont manage to pay off your debt until the deadline, the interest is raised to 40%. Buying an existing acre costs {reg9} aurums, while it sells for {reg10} aurums. Building a new one requires {reg11} aurums. The rent paid to landowners currently accumulates to {reg13} aurums per acre every week and has to be collected in the town. Land wont be rented if a town is already well supplied.

qstr_When_enabled_this_ca|When enabled, this causes horses to travel slower as they take damage.
qstr_Ticked_autocalculate|Ticked, autocalculated battles give advantage to factions on their home terrain. Unticked, as in Native and auto-battles are only based on party size and troop levels.
qstr_Allows_exiled_lords_|Allows exiled lords to be pardoned after a time and rejoin a faction to prevent 'lord-drain' in the late game.
qstr_Low:^^___Center_poin|Low:^^ - Center points for fief allocation are calculated (villages 1 / castles 2 / towns 3) instead of (villages 1 / castles 1 / towns 2).^^ - For qst rescue prisoner and qst offer gift, the relatives that can be a target of the quest have been extended to include uncles and aunts and in-laws.^^ - Alterations to script calculate troop score for center (these changes currently are only relevant during claimant quests).^^ - When picking a new faction, lords are more likely to return to their original faction (except when that's the faction they're being exiled from), if the ordinary conditions for rejoining are met.  A lord's decision may also be influenced by his relations with other lords in the various factions, instead of just his relations with the faction leaders.^^Medium:^^ - Some changes for lord relation gains/losses when fiefs are allocated.^^ - Kings overrule lords slightly less frequently on faction issues.^^ - In deciding who to support for a fief, minor parameter changes for certain personalities. Some lords will still give priority to fiefless lords or to the lord who conquered the center if they have a slightly negative relation (normally the cutoff is 0 for all personalities).^^ - When a lord can't find any good candidates for a fief under the normal rules, instead of automatically supporting himself he uses a weighted scoring scheme.^^ - In various places where 'average renown * 3/2' appears, an alternate calculation is sometimes used.^^High:^^ - The 'renown factor' when an NPC lord or the player courts and NPC lady is adjusted by the prestige of the lady's guardian.^^ - When a faction has fiefless lords and no free fiefs left, under some circumstances the king will redistribute a village he owns.^^
qstr_Low:^^___Caravan_tra|Low:^^ - Caravan trade benefits both the source and the destination^^ - When the player surrenders, there is a chance his personal equipment will not be looted, based on who accepted the surrender and the difficulty setting. (This is meant to address a gameplay issue. In the first 700 days or so, there is no possible benefit to surrendering rather than fighting to the last man.) Also, a bug that made it possible for books etc. to be looted was corrected.^^ - AI caravans take into consideration distance when choosing their next destination and will be slightly more like to visit their own faction. This strategy is mixed with the Native one, so the trade pattern will differ but not wildly.^^ - Scale town merchant gold by prosperity (up to a maximum 40% change).^^ - Food prices increase in towns that have been under siege for at least 48 hours.^^ - In towns the trade penalty script has been tweaked to make it more efficient to sell goods to merchants specializing in them.^^Medium:^^ - Food consumption increases in towns as prosperity increases.^^   Consumption also increases with garrison sizes.^^ - Lords' looting skill affects how much gold they take from the player when they defeat him.^^ - Lords' leadership skill modifies their troop wage costs the same way it does for the player.^^ - The player can lose gold when his fiefs are looted, like lords.^^ - The same way that lord party sizes increase as the player progresses, mercenary party sizes also increase to maintain their relevance. (The rate is the same as for lords: a 1.25% increase per level.)^^ - If the player has a kingdom of his own, his spouse will receive part of the bonus that ordinarily would be due a liege.  The extent of this bonus depends on the number of fiefs the players holds. This bonus is non-cumulative with the marshall bonus.^^ - Attrition is inflicted on NPC-owned centers if they can't pay wages, but only above a certain threshold.^^ - Strangers cannot acquire enterprises (enforced at 1 instead of at 0, so you have to do something).^^High: - The total amount of weekly bonus gold awarded to kings in Calradia   remains constant: as kings go into exile, their bonuses are divided among the remaining kings.^^ - If lord's run a personal gold surplus after party wages, the extra is divided among the lord and his garrisons budgets (each castle and town has its own pool of funds to pay for soldiers) on the basis of whether the lord is low on gold or any of his fortresses are. (If none are low   on gold, the lord takes everything, like before.)^^ - The honor loss from an offense depends in part on the player's honor   at the time.  The purer the reputation, the greater the effect of a single disagrace.^^ - Raiding change: village gold lost is removed from uncollected taxes before the balance (if any) is removed from the lord.^^ - Cash for prisoners
qstr_Disabled_levels_the_|Disabled levels the playing-field for female player characters. Default as in Native. High increases the sexism/anti-woman prejudice of the medieval setting for female player characters.
qstr_If_checked_this_disa|If checked this disables the formation mod.^^Default = Disabled

qstr_This_sets_the_color_|This sets the color of the stamina bar.
qstr_When_checked_this_wi|When checked, this will cause any mounted rider (player or AI) to receive damage when their mount is taken out from under them.  Damage is increased based upon the speed the mount was moving and the total weight of the rider and reduced by the rider's riding skill.^^Note: Turning this off will help CPU performance.
qstr_When_checked_the_pla|When checked, the player and companions will have penalties to athletics, shield, power draw, riding & horse archery based upon the total weight of their equipment.^^Note: Turning this off will greatly help CPU performance.
qstr_When_enabled_this_pr|When enabled, this prevents villagers from joining your side while you're defending their village.

qstr_As_a_child_your_fami|As a child, your family scrabbled out a meagre living from your father's wages as a guardsman to the local lord.

qstr_You_were_the_{reg3?d|You were the {reg3?daughter:son} of a family who lived off the woods, doing whatever they needed to make ends meet.

qstr_As_the_{reg3?daughte|As the {reg3?daughter:son} of a thief, you had very little 'formal' education.  Instead you were out on the street, begging until you learned how to cut purses, cutting purses until you learned how to pick locks, all the way through your childhood.

qstr_You_couldn_t_just_st|You couldn't just stay aside when a nearby kingdom attacked your faction, so you were among the first to join the army.

qstr_It_became_both_your_|It became both your work and hobby. First of all, you just liked capturing criminals and locking them up in prisons. At the same time, your good tracking skill got you a lot of money for a couple of difficult bounties.

Fighting for your life, you travelled a long way to Galwe and spent several weeks consulting with renowned doctors, but mostly, due to lack of their time and your money, studying coursebooks in the library. Eventually you found the exact description of your desease in an old book, followed by a detailed recipe of the cure, which you managed to prepare without anyone else's help.

You were instructed in your obligations to your lord, and of your duties to those who might one day be your vassals.

qstr_Though_the_distinction|Though the distinction felt sudden to you, somewhere along the way you had become a {reg3?woman:man}, and the whole world seemed to change around you.  You joined the tightly-knit circle of women at court, ladies who all did proper ladylike things, the wives and mistresses of noble men as well as maidens who had yet to find a husband.  However, even here you found politics at work as the ladies schemed for prominence and fought each other bitterly to catch the eye of whatever unmarried man was in fashion at court.  You soon learned ways of turning these situations and goings-on to your advantage. With it came the realisation that you yourself could wield great influence in the world, if only you applied yourself with a little bit of subtlety.
