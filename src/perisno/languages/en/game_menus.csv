mno_start_dwarf_karnoth|Karnoth, the capital of the Dwarven Kingdom.
mno_start_dwarf_native_warband_backstory|A land far from Perisno (Classic Start).
menu_start_character_1_karnoth_dwarf|You began your life as a young dwarf born to a Kaikoth Ironfist, one of the fiercest dwarven fighters around. However, your father died in a war with the Hakkon Empire when you were but an infant, and you were raised by your mother.
menu_start_character_2_karnoth_dwarf|Your father's brothers in arms taught you how to the basics in wielding a sword when you were young, but, as life went on, those father figures soon left your life. Their training, however, stayed with you. At this point your mother had sold off the rest of your father's wealth; save for one banner from his conquests, which she refused to sell.
menu_start_character_3_karnoth_dwarf|You were forced to take up work in the mines, even as a young {reg3?girl:boy}, to provide for your family. You managed to eke out a living and provide for your mother, but not much else.
menu_start_character_4_karnoth_dwarf|Eventually, you were able to earn yourself dwarven armor of your own by squiring to one of the ironfists, your father's former comrade. This meant you needed to work in the mines even more however; to provide for your family and for half the cost of each piece of your expensive equipment. However, one day you saw something amiss in the mines...
menu_start_character_1_tropical_human|You never knew your mother, no doubt some whore your father took a fancy to on his travels. All that was told to you was that one time when your father returned from a trading voyage, he brought a child with him, claiming it to be his seed.
menu_start_character_2_tropical_human|You grew up helping him with his trading, living well in whatever city you were in, then coming back to the village for a time to deposit your earnings in your growing estate.
menu_start_character_3_tropical_human|Then, you went onto one more trading mission. This one was to the Aroulo islands to the west, tribal places, mostly ignored by the main kingdoms in Perisno.
menu_start_character_4_tropical_human|To your dismay, a group of pirates attacked your ship, destroying it and killing your father, along with the rest of the crew. You managed to escape by swimming to a nearby island.
menu_start_character_1_north_human|You were born into this world the {reg3?daughter:son} of a family of warriors and fishermen on your small island; which your kinsmen called Hylr.
menu_start_character_2_north_human|Your father had the name Izgromar, but he died when you were young. Your only memory of him is the time he returned from a raid, and taught you to throw the spear. Following his death, besides fishing for subsistence, you spent your early days training, your goal to honor the name of your father.
menu_start_character_3_north_human|You were poorer than most, but given your skill with the spear, you did not go hungry much. As you grew older, you trained more with your weapons, and finally were accepted to the next raiding party travelling to the rich Valahir lands to the south.
menu_start_character_4_north_human|The raid went well at first. When a Valahir patrol came upon the party, your leader, Torsson, managed to fight off three Hersirs singlehandedly. You even managed to kill a Thrall or two. However, one bit of Valahir scum in the patrol managed to escape, and soon after, Aethling Svafar himself descended upon you. Your wits left you, and several other men, and you and your party rode back to your ship as fast as humanly possible on your stolen horses, left with but a pittance; without your leader.
