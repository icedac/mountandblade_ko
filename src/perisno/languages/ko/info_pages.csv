Most of them are accessed via your minister and several other new potential employees: a chamberlain, a constable, and a chancellor. You gain the opportunity to hire a chamberlain when you receive your first village, a constable when you gain your first castle, and a chancellor when you gain your first town. If you dismiss one of your employees, you may be able to rehire them through a well-connected spouse or one of the travellers who frequent the taverns of Perisno.^^Aside from these the mod has other features as well, which can be accessed from the Camp menu.^^This mod uses Diplomacy Version 4.3 (Sept 22, 2012)."

It allows you to have your companions (named heroes, not ordinary soldiers) automatically select equipment from the looted items after a battle.^^In order for this feature to be enabled, one of the following must be true:^- Someone in your party must have a Looting score of 2 or better, someone in your party must have an Inventory Management skill of 3 or more.^- The player himself must have an Inventory Management skill of 2 or more."
ip_dplmc_autosell|"기능: 자동 판매"
ip_dplmc_autosell_text|"The Auto Sell feature allows you to sell numerous items to a merchant all at once, instead of selling each item individually. Auto Sell settings are managed through the Town menu, where you can specify which types of items you want to be able to sell (e.g. you might not want to automatically sell horses) and a price limit (for example, you might not want to automatically sell any items that cost more than 200 aurums).^^There are two primary ways to use Auto Sell. If you speak to a Horse Merchant, Armorer, or Weapon Merchant in a town, there is a conversation option to sell items of a particular type. Also, when visiting a town, there will be an option in the Marketplace section of the menu to automatically sell your items throughout the town.^^For people who used Auto Sell in other mods, note that this sells from your own inventory, according to certain rules. Items you have equipped will never be sold, and neither will the first three items in your inventory.  After that, autosell also skips anything that it thinks might be your personal equipment (since people often have more than one set). Regardless of whether you have them equipped, it won't sell your best bow, crossbow, armor, helmet, boots, or gloves. If you have a bow you can use, it won't sell your best three packs of arrows, and if you have a crossbow, it won't sell your best three packs of bolts. For shields, one-handed weapons, two-handed weapons, polearms, and horses, it won't sell your best or second-best item. Your best three throwing weapons also will not be sold. However, items that your character is unable to use are considered fair game."
ip_morale|"기록: 사기"
ip_morale_text|"Morale represents the ability and willingness of the troops in a party to summon up the endurance, bravery, and discipline they need to face the stresses of battle and the march. It is not the same thing as the troops' happiness. Elite troops may grumble and whine about the hardships of campaigning -- but then stand together as one when the arrows start to fly. On the other hand, a commander who gives his men everything they want may find that they grow soft, and waiver before the enemy's charge.^^ Morale's greatest impact is on a party's behavior in battle, determining how aggressively troops engage the enemy, and how likely they are to break and run if they perceive the tide of battle turning against them. Morale also affects a party's march speed, as a less motivated party will move more slowly, as the men are not pushing themselves to their physical limit, and pause more frequently, as it waits for stragglers to catch up. Finally, a party with very low morale will start to suffer desertions.^^ Some factors that affect morale are intuitive. For example, a charismatic commander with a reputation for winning battles can infuse his or her men with a sense of confidence. Leaders who give their men well ample and varied supplies of food, and pay them on time, demonstrate that they care about their troops' welfare, and are less likely to lead them into disaster.^^ Other factors are less intuitive -- particularly those related to a party's sense of group cohesion. In a small tight-knit party, for example, men will often fight hard against daunting odds to avoid showing cowardice before their comrades-in-arms. A large party on the other hand may see its cohesion strained, as the commander has less time to supervise the men, listen to their grievances, and resolve their disputes. Frequent battles will strengthen the bonds between men, while long periods without combat will see the troops become bored and quarrelsome.^^ The morale report, accessibly by hitting the 'reports' button will give the player a sense of the factors affecting his or her men's morale."
ip_economy|"기록: 경제"
ip_economy_text|"Towns and villages in Perisno need a wide variety of goods for their populations to remain healthy and productive. First in importance is food. Grain is the staple crop of Perisno, but people also need fat and protein in the form of meat, fish, or cheese. It takes almost as much work to preserve meat as to produce it in the first place, so salt is also in high demand. After food comes clothing: heavy wool, lighter linens, or luxurious velvet. Finally, people need the tools of their trade: ironware, pottery, leatherware, and, of course, arms, armor, and horses for war.^^Most agricultural products are produced in the villages, while artisans in the towns specialize in manufactured or artisanal goods like fabrics or ironware. Also, different resources can be found in different parts of the country. Consequently, the key to prosperity in Perisno is trade -- both between the villages and the towns, and between the major towns themselves.^^When trade flows, goods will be available and affordable, the population of a center will be healthy and energetic, and migrants will flock from the nearby regions. The center will produce more, consume more, and be able to contribute more in taxes to their lords. When trade dries up, towns and villages will see their workers flee to seek work elsewhere, and economic activity will drift to a stand-still. Thus, it is in the interests of rulers to protect trade routes from the hazards of war and banditry. A smart merchant, however, may want to seek out towns which have become isolated from the rest of the land, as he or she may be able to turn a tidy profit from the resulting price imbalances.^^Because villagers usually plan to take their goods to market in towns, village markets will be rather quiet places, and villagers will buy cheap and sell dear. Serious merchants will stick to the towns to make a profit, although some parties may decide to make a quick stop in a village to acquire supplies.^^A player who wants to know about the factors affecting a region's prosperity can speak to the guildmaster of the local town. Other information can be gleaned from passers-by, although they might not know very much outside of their own particular trade."

ip_foraging_text|"To sustain and keep large armies happy you will need high morale, and one thing that helps build a high morale is food. Introducing Foraging, where you and your troops live off of the land. Foraging will not provide food items, it simply reduces the food consumed at each meal. This is an Agility based party skill with max level of 10. The skill level (modified by party bonus) sets a hard limit of the maximum number of food unit that can be foraged. For example, even if you can forage 30 food units from the area and you have only 1 level you foraging, you'll get a 5 units reduction to food consumption. The amount foraged has a bonus of x1.5 if camping (standard camp, waiting 24h on siege). The amount of food that can be foraged depends on local resources"
ip_courtship|"기록: 이성 교제"
ip_courtship_text|"Players may wish to marry into one of Perisno's noble families. Marriage is not necessary for a player to rise in power and stature, but it does provide players with an opportunity to improve their relation with lords and establish a claim to the throne.^^Marriage requirements will be different for males and females. A male character will usually need to pursue a traditional path of courtship. He should establish a reputation in Perisnon aristocratic society, get on good terms with his bride's parents or guardians, and then woo the lady according to local custom. If a player grows impatient, he may attempt to take a shortcut -- but there will be consequences in his relations with other lords.^^A male character should keep in mind that other lords will be competing with him for the affections of the kingdom's ladies. Also, a lady's tastes are unpredictable, and a player may also find that the object of his love does not love him in return. Romance, in Perisno as elsewhere, does not always prosper. Of course, a player may resort to other, less gentlemanly means of winning a lady's heart, but again, that will have a serious impact on his reputation.^^To get started on the path of courtship, a male player should try to get involved in the social life of the Perisnon aristocracy, attending feasts and tournaments. Also, wandering troubadours and poets can serve as a useful repository of information on courtship, and keep the player up to date about the latest gossip.^^Female characters can also marry -- but they should keep in mind that Perisnon society is very traditional, and, as adventurers, they have chosen a very unconventional path for a woman. A female character may have to look for a while to find a lord who is open-minded enough to marry her.^^On the bright side, a female character does not have to go through the elaborate rituals of courtship, and she also may gain more from a marriage than her male counterpart. For a woman adventurer, marriage can be a quick path to power -- and an unscrupulous character may be able to use her husband as a tool of her political ambitions."
ip_politics|"기록: 정치"
ip_politics_text|"The realms of Perisno, although they represent different cultures, all adhere to the same basic political system: feudalism. Feudalism is based on the relationships between individuals: the oaths of loyalty given by a vassal to his or her liege. In exchange for this oath, the vassal will usually receive a fief, a parcel of land whose income will be used by the vassal to raise troops to support the liege in time of war. A liege also has an obligation to protect his vassals, and to treat them justly.^^This is how it works in theory, anyway. In practice, vassals will not always work in their factions' interests, particular as they are often quarreling with one another. Nobles have different personalities, and sometimes those personalities clash. Or, perhaps two nobles were once friends, but fell out over in the aftermath of a setback or a defeat -- or because they both were wooing the same lady. Jealousies will also surface as they vie for the favor of the king -- perhaps over newly conquered lands, or over who will be given the coveted office of marshal, the lord in charge of organizing large-scale campaigns.^^When one realm in Perisno makes war on another, the political unity of the each kingdom is as important as the quality or number of its soldiers in determining the outcome. In a cohesive kingdom, nobles will join together in a large force to sweep their opponents before them. In a kingdom divided by petty quarrels, lords will fail to respond to the marshal's summons, or drift away to attend to their own business if a campaign is not going well. A faction's political cohesion will also impact warfare when campaigns are not in progress. In a divided faction, lords will be less likely to join together on raids and patrols, and come to each other's defense.^^If it seems self-defeating for nobles to bicker and quarrel when the enemy is just over the horizon, keep this in mind -- ultimately, a noble's loyalty goes not to a particular faction or culture, but to himself and to his family. If a noble fears that his faction is collapsing, or if he is being neglected by his liege, he can usually find a reason to withdraw his oath of allegiance, and change sides. Players should keep this in mind, as they may find that there are opportunities to turn discontented former enemies into allies."

ip_character_backgrounds|"기록: 캐릭터 배경"
ip_character_backgrounds_text|"A player character in Perisno may choose from a variety of social backgrounds to originate from. This choice will affect not just his or her starting skills and equipment, but also the course of his or her career as an adventurer.^^War and politics in Perisno are traditionally dominated by male aristocrats. A nobleman player character may find that he is invited into this 'old boys' club' fairly quickly, but women and commoners may face a few extra hurdles on the way. If you choose to start the game as a male nobleman, you can think of it as the 'easy' setting. Starting as a noblewoman or a male commoner is somewhat more difficult, and starting as a female commoner is probably the most challenging way to begin a game.^^However, women have some starting advantages. Simply by taking up arms, a female warrior will draw attention to herself, and she may find that she can build up her reputation faster than a male. Also, it is traditionally easier for a woman to marry up the social ladder than it is for a man, and a woman may find she can gain more from a strategic marital alliance than her male counterpart.^^Finally, keep in mind that the game does not place any limits on the upward mobility of characters based on their background. Noble or common, male or female, married or unmarried -- anyone can rise to become ruler of all Perisno, if they are sufficiently brave, lucky, or resourceful."
ip_military_campaigns|"기록: 군대의 원정"
ip_military_campaigns_text|"When kingdoms in Perisno go to war, their armies have two basic offensive options. They can try to attack villages and lay waste to the countryside, damaging their enemy's prestige and economy. Or, they can try to seize and hold castles or towns, taking territory This second option can involve long, bloody sieges, but will yield more decisive results.^^It is important to note that the realms of Perisno do not field standing armies, which remain in the field as long as the ruler desires. Rather, Perisnon realms are protected by feudal levies comprised of the major nobles and their individual retinues.  Sometimes, these nobles launch their own private attacks into enemy territory, but the most decisive events will usually take place when the great hosts are assembled. The kingdom's marshal, a noble appointed by the king, will summon the host before the campaign and lead them out to battle. However, he should be careful not to keep them in the field too long. Otherwise, the host will begin to disintegrate, as the vassals drift off to pursue their own business, and the army will be vulnerable to a counter-attack.^^For this reason, the rhythm of wars in Perisno often resemble the rhythm of a duel between two individual combatants. One side will gather its strength and seek to land a blow against the enemy's territory. If the marshal spends too little time gathering the vassals, he may not be able to do any real damage. If he spends too much time, then the campaign may end before it has even begun. A large realm will have an advantage over a smaller one, just as a brawny combatant has an edge over a smaller foe, but a realm's political cohesion can also be a factor, just as a fighter with great stamina can outlast her opponent. Sometimes, the armies of two realms will meet head on, resulting in a major battle in which both numbers and morale will decide the outcome.^^Kingdoms will have imperfect intelligence about their enemies. Attacking lords will need to frequently scout enemy territory to determine which fortresses may be vulnerable. An army defending its homeland will benefit from the alarms raised by castles and towns, which broadcast intelligence about enemy movements in the area. Such intelligence will be imprecise, however, particularly when it comes to numbers. A defending force which sets out to raise a siege or rescue a village may be able to overwhelm an unprepared attacker -- or it may miscalculate, and find that it is the one to be overwhelmed. Attackers, in turn, must be careful how far they advance into enemy territory, with aggressive marshals venturing further than cautious ones.^^Players will be expected to join in their faction's military campaign, either by joining the host, or by scouting ahead into enemy territory. Some players may find that their realm's marshal is too cautious, or too aggressive, for their tastes. In this case, they can intrigue with other lords to try to replace the marshal, or build support to become the marshal themselves.^^Most wars are of limited duration. A king who goes to war will, for the sake of honor, feel obligated to pursue the conflict for a short while. However, unless he is soundly beating his enemy. he may soon start looking for a way out of the conflict, lest he leave himself vulnerable to an attack by a third party. Perisno's rulers are keenly aware that today's ally may be tomorrow's enemy, and vice versa."

They remained haunted by their experiences in Hakkon, but the leaders are determined to start a new life in Perisno.^^From the journal of Captain Otto Waveshore:^^Day 1:^^We have fled from Hakkon, deciding that enough is enough. We will start a new life somewhere else, in a place far from Hakkon. Far enough for them to never be able to find us. We have begun to set sail, a motley bunch of men leaving on stolen ships, given to us by our good friend Admiral Themistocles. He will be punished for what he has done, but he knew the risks, as we all did.

Half of our ships have sunk, either to marauding  pirates or to large sea monsters or to large storms in the ocean. Every day, our crew pray to Priapus, our God of Sailers.^^Day Unknown:^^It is unbelievable. We have caught sight of the mainland at last! Our men are settling down in this new, lush land, which we name the land of Perisno. We have not met any natives and no sign of life is seen at all! I worry that our generations will not live on. My health is failing, and I think this will be my last entry. - Captain Otto Waveshore^^Tolrania was founded in the year 323. They are a Republic, vowing that they would be different from the Hakkon Empire. They prospered for seven years in this new land, free of the tyranny of Hakkon and King Comrey. They made trade with the Maccavians and thrived. The population quadrupled in those years, and soon Tolrania expanded. In year 330, something unexpected happened: the Hakkons followed the into Perisno.^^At first, there was shock from the Tolranians, then there was anger. The, there was despair as the Tolranians found out how big the Hakkon fleet was.^^Apparently, these were knights and nobles also dissatisfied with King Comrey, and had set out to a new world. Almost every Tolranian there were second generation, and few of the first generation were still alive. However, their fathers told them of the horrors in Hakkon.^^They decided to turn to the local Elintoran Elves for help. The Elven Archers were a mercenary company, and they were hired by Tolrania to do battle against Hakkon. In a famous battle, the Tolranians routed the Hakkon army.^^Hakkon was not defeated, but they needed time to rebuild their armies. The people of Tolrania rejoiced after this, and they continued to thrive.^^Near the woods of Tolrania, an outlaw group began to form. The outlaws called the Tolranian government corrupt and disorderly. They said that the name 'Republic' itself was hypocritical. The government ruled like a kingdom, and the other factions acknowledged this. Tolrania was given the name of The Kingdom of Tolrania by other factions, and soon it was only the Tolranians who called themselves a Republic.^^The outlaws, led by an enigmatic man named Nibor Hood, became a large organization that were constantly a thorn to the Tolranian's side.^^Tolrania is ruled by a King, after abandoning the idea of a republic. They have a strong military, and their Kingsmen are the envy of the world. Their military is diverse, with horse archers, foot archers, and infantry. Most of their military are peasants recruited from villages. They rely on their top tier noble troops for heavy cavalry.

They arrived at Perisno in the year 363, and it was clear that their intentions was not to trade, but to conquer. They brought a huge armada with them, deploying thousands of soldiers into Perisnoan soil. They quickly colonized some native cities and changed them into large, industrial metropolises. They also built fortresses and fortifications of tremendous size in what was soon 'their territory' and soldiers patrolled the borders regularly.

They have never really cared about the western world, which they call the 'Ghareeb.' They are a reclusive nation, mostly staying in their deserts, never daring to venture more than a few miles into the lands without desert. They are a hardy people, being able to live in that harshest environments. Most tribes are nomadic, but some of the bigger tribes have settled in cities near water and other resources. The Draharans are also religious, believing in spirits and gods. Throughout the Draharan desert, ancient shrines and majestic temples can be found dedicated to their gods. Drahara is a term used for an entire ethnic group of people, and many tribesmen find it offensive to be called Draharan instead of being called by their respective clan or tribe name. It has been like that for hundreds of years, but around the year 354, everything changed.^^An unnamed man walked into the capital city of the largest Draharan tribe and proclaimed himself a man sent by the gods. He could work wonders and perform miracles, and soon many people followed him. He said that he dreamt of a day where the Draharans ruled Perisno, when all the unworthy Ghareebians of the West bowed under their rule. He was so mesmerizing, and his voice so powerful, that everyone that heard him would believe him and pledge their allegiance to him. Soon, after five years, all the Draharan tribes had united under this man, and their armies were ready to march. First, he immediately used the military to wipe out every single bandit party in the desert that they could find. Every desert rat and vulture that robbed other men were found and executed under this man's order. Drahara soon became free of such men, but it is rumored they are still hiding in reclusive corners, waiting for revenge. This unnamed man continued to assert his dominance, and trained an elite guard of camel riders for himself. He had the tribe of elephant riders pledge their allegiance to him as well, and even the infamous Desert Assassins. By the year 365, the Draharans were ready to march for war.^^Under their new mysterious ruler, Drahara became a confederation. Every lord had his personal army but all fought for one cause: the conquest of the west. However, there were a few people that doubted this mysterious new man, and openly proclaimed it. The strongest man against this new ruler was named Baibars. He voiced his protests against this new ruler of Drahara, saying that he had no right to rule. He was cast out and shunned, but remains alive, waiting for someone to help him. He now goes from kingdom to kingdom, trying to find support.^^The Draharan military is simple: they have archers, spearmen, and cavalry. However, due of the hotness of the desert, they do not wear very heavy armor.

In a notorious battle, called the Battle of Halfith, Tolrania and Elinotor combined forces to defeat Hakkon. In that battle, the Tolranians realized exactly how strong the Elven archers were. It was only because of the archers that they managed to defeat the Hakkon army. The archers fired volley after volley at the Hakkon Legionnaires, and when they tried to send in the lancers, they were outfought by the Tolranian horse archers. After routing the Hakkon, the Elintorans went back into a reclusive nation and eventually broke off good relations with the Tolranians. Forty years later they are fighting a bitter war against each other for unclear reasons.^^Currently, the Elintoran Nation is ruled by Queen Arwen. It is not strange for women to have high positions of power in the Elven hierarchy, and some of the most notorious Elintoran rulers were in fact Queens.

They are a strange group, and no one knows the exact reason of their division. Some say it was because of a civil war while others say it was because of the Geldarins being a completely different species of Elves who felt they were the minority.

They revolutionized sailing technology, and rumor had it that their navy was so great and had such survivability that they could sail the entire world and not one would sink. Hakkon quickly dominated other small island tribes around them, and set about colonizing the mainland. Many of their efforts failed, and around the year 315, Hakkon was on the verge of collapse. Pestilence, corruption, and war had taken its toll on the once great Hakkon Empire.^^In the year 322, Emperor Comrey II was crowned Emperor of Hakkon. He was a lazy and indolent man who cared for nothing but food, wine, and women. He was nothing like his father, Emperor Comrey I, who was a great man and helped rebuild much of Hakkon after its economic downfall. Emperor Comrey II held lavish feasts in his palace almost daily, and the only times he didn't hold them were the times he was too drunk to do anything. Throughout the kingdom, the people murmured and voiced their disgust of their new creature of a King. In the year 323,  six months after Comrey II was crowned, the people had had enough. Admiral Themistocles, a powerful and wealthy man, arranged the escape of four ships that would sail into a new land to settle. He himself was a seasoned veteran of many battles, but chose to stay even though his people begged him to go. He vowed he would continue helping the people against their new tyrant. In the year 323, the men were ready to sail, and all of them left with high hopes of a new life in a new world.^^By the year 329, Emperor Comrey II was still on the throne, but he was so fat and lazy by now that his ministers had taken over ruling the kingdom for him until a more suitable heir could be selected. The Hakkon Empire continued to crumble, and many of their nobles were anxious to leave. A large fleet of Hakkon nobles and soldiers left the island and went in the footsteps of the Tolranians in search of a new world. By the year 330, they had arrived in Perisno and immediately began colonizing it. They called themselves the Hakkon Empire, and called the one they had come from the Old Hakkon Empire.^^For many years, the Hakkon Empire grew in size and prosperity. They frequently fought with the Tolranians, and even though they lost many battles, they were powerful and could rebuild quickly and efficiently.^^The Hakkon Empire is a monarchy, and their current king is King Hakkon II 'The Great,' named after the Hakkons of old. They are an efficient government, having access to many trade routes and natural resources.  Their military is solid all around, and fields a variety of units. They have heavy cavalry, heavy infantry, spearmen, and crossbowmen.^^In the year 350, trouble emerged after the death of King Hakkon IV. He left no successor, and now Hakkon nobles were fighting each other in a heated civil war. The rest of the world only watched the conflict, no one making a move to interfere. The two sides were the Hammeriron family and the Hakkon family. Ultimately, the Hakkon family won after many bloody battles, and King Hakkon III was crowned. However, the Hammeriron leader, Mjolnir, is still alive and looking for revenge. Trouble once again came to the Hakkons in the year 355. New raiders, called the Volheere raiders, migrated to Perisno near Hakkon lands and began to loot and kill anyone in their way. By the year 362, they became a very large threat. The Hakkons still have not managed to deal with them yet."

The Volheere Raiders are only an offshoot of their clan and even though the Volheeres left the island because of harsh weather and no food, the Valahir clan still rules and lives by demanding tribute from their conquered tribes. The Valahir Clan is now eyeing Perisno as well, because of its resources and new places to settle, but many are reluctant to go. The Valahir Clan is ruled by Clan Leader Ingveld, and his subjects all have the title of Aethling. The troop tree is all infantry and archers but they are very heavy infantry and all of them can match the Maccavian Northguards. Should the Valahir clan under Ingveld rally his army together, the Maccavians and possibly the whole of Perisno, will be at risk..."
ip_falconlore|"지식: 팔콘 렐름"
ip_falconlore_text|"The Realm Of The Falcon split up from Elintor in the early days of the Elvarie's arrival to Perisno. In 323 a few Elintoran Nobles decided that endless wars and fruitless negotiations, led only by the intention to continue with the bloodshed for the sake of honor, could no longer be their way and also couldn't provide the future, they dreamed of, for their people.They decided that it was better to live a rather poor and simple life than being just invaders and power-hungry plunderers to a land that was not their own. Elintor, being constantly at war with the other kingdoms of Perisno, couldn't prevent them and their followers from leaving Forniron. They quickly disappeared into the great woods, adjoining the territories, later inhabited by the Hakkon, finally settling at the foot of the mountains.^^The isolation they chose, protected them as planned from the persecution of Elintor and other Kingdoms and still being considered only another band of outlaws, neither Elintor nor other kingdoms were willing to sacrifice valuable ressources to go after them - they were left in peace.A peace which allowed them to grow in numbers, using their good relations to some Tolranian lords to establish trade routes. After all, the Tolranians had come to Perisno for the same reason, those nobles and their followers had split up from Elintor and the fact that there were still lords of Tolrania, opposing these endless wars, made them sympathize with -and protect each other.^^As they settled down, they quickly found out that there was already someone living in the woods nearby. A group of people with their own rites and beliefs.^^They were already followers of the new gods, living in harmony with nature. These people, as well as their believes quickly became part of the Realm's culture and today nobody could tell assuredly who aligned with whom, but something that for sure can be said is, that their believes were very similar to each other and therefore brought no reason for a struggle.So from the beginning, The Realm Of The Falcon not only respected other folk, but their animals as well and being partly Elvarie still, they used their strong empathy to become friends of the creatures they were depending on, rather than dominating them. They had learned that bonds thus established are alot stronger and more effective. A reason for this as well might have been the ever rising number of refugees from all corners of Perisno, affiliating to their population and knowledge. Desperate people with hopes for a better future for themselves and their children arrived, after rumors of a somehow peaceful life in the Realm Of The Falcon reached their ears. They were Tolranian peasants, Maccavian Smiths and Traders from the Reich, fleeing the tax burdons and inhumane treatment by their lords.^^After a few years, this growing community blossomed into a sovereign State that at last gave itself the Name Realm Of The Falcon originating from the falcon that assists their nobles on the hunt. For hunting on horseback with a falcon was a discipline the lords brought from Elintor and the falcon being a symbol for witness, agility and chivalry...But a community growing bigger also had to be well protected, so in 340, when more and more caravans got raided by the Hakkon Emperor on their no longer secret but rather long routes, the lord's council decided to build up an army, incomparable to others and very hard to defeat. Still lacking the strength in numbers, compared to the other states, they decided that only a strong cavalry could be a big enough deterrent to protect them from being extinguished again in a surprise attack. Heavy-heartedly they implemented a conscription, knowing that the perspective to get killed in one of their lord's wars, had been the reason for so much folk to join the Realm in the first place.^^Nevertheless most people understood and in 341 the first recruits mounted their horses; formidable horses, for they were descendants of the Elvarie horses, brought by their owners from Elintor and one of the reasons as well, because of which the caravans had gotten raided so often.^^ For their horses were the most important trade good of The Realm Of The Falcon and the Golden Hall in the center of their only city could never have been constructed if not with the income that horsetrade had generated. This was only possible, because more and more terrain of the great woods had to be cleared with the growing number of people that crops had to be grown for. These grounds were also best suitable for horse-breeding.From 341 on, there were more and more skirmishes with the Hakkon Empire and fears grew within The Realm Of The Falcon that an open war might become unavoidable and was only postponed by the empire because of continous fights against the other kingdoms.^^In 345 the war broke out, but it turned out that The Realm's strategy of enhanced cavalry was most effective. The Lords had elected a Marshal that temporarily had the same authorities like a king. Only temporarily though, because those Lords believed in a more democratic way and most of them remembered the consequences in laying too much power into the hands of a single individual. The man they elected wasn't even a noble, but the oldest son of a Maccavian family that emmigrated to the Realm Of The Falcon in 325. He had shown himself to be very skilled as he had climbed the ranks of the new build army unbelievably fast, showing extraordinary intelligence, tactical intuition as well as courage. His name was Gunnar and after his victory over Emperor Hakkon II in 346 in the Battle of Amarna he was honored with the honorary title The Falcon after he had conquered the city. Amarna was later returned in exchange for recognition and the guaranty of the trade routes.^^The Hakkon Empire had underestimated the Realm's strength and in particular the determined militancy of its priests, that, fom their appearance alone, can instill terror on someone. They were ignorant enough to take on Gunnars troops in an open-field-battle, which led to their shameful defeat.^^ After the peace agreement, the army was quickly rebuilt and the Realm Of The Falcon flourished through trade like never before, for the trade routes were then considered save, at least from the Hakkon raids. This, of course, incited desires within the other kingdoms for the wealth thus created and only through means of extremely cautious diplomacy, The Realm Of The Falcon avoided another war until...In 365 it happened...Rumors of a new invasion to Perisno reached the Realm. The people shuddered upon the atrocities that were said to be comitted by the unknown foe, much harder to defeat as any other army. And again the Lords decided to send Gunnar to oppose this new great danger that had come over the already war-torn lands of Perisno..."

For centureis, the nomadic inhabitants lived in peace on the vast continent.^^However, tension grew as the once isolated nomadic families were forced to interact with each other as the population grew. Around year 29 families began banding together into tribes as the first violent conflicts erupted and dark times fell over The Great Plain.^^One day, a prophet named Kesser appeared and began preaching peace, begging the people to stop their senseless violence. He told them that a god would punish them for their wicked ways, but the nomads worshipped the spirits of their ancestors and didn't believe in gods. ^^Year 36 - A meteorite hits the center of the continent, creating a massive crater. Kesser was the only survivor. The people from the uneffected areas of the continent began gathering to him, seeing his miraculous survival as divine intervention. Kesser then took the meteorite ore and made weapons from it that surpassed the work of the greatest craftsmen, calling it Dimir. The people made Kesser their Hakan, or ruler, marking the beginning of the Turan Empire and the worship of Kesser's god, Tangir. ^^Year 53 - Kesser passes away, and his second in command Dimir, who named himself after the meteorite ore, becomes the new ruler. He immediately reinforces his power by repressing several nomadic nobles and gaining the support of the Turan people and elders. ^^Years 60-200 - The golden age of the Turan Empire. ^^Year 221 - A merchant ship from Hakkon arrives at the Great Plain. A trade deal is signed between Hakkon and Turan.^^Year 223 - Hakan Kulak dies under mysterious circumstances and his regime is overthrown. Kulak's wife, son, and daughter escape.

Several tribes leave Turan Empire.^^Years 240-262 - 35-year war against Hakkon ends with a temporary truce. The Turan Empire managed to retake a part of the lost territory, but the rest of it remains in the hands of Hakkon. Olen falls in battle against rebel tribes. His younger brother - Anyz - is chosen to be the new Hakan. Anyz's right to rule is supported by a legend that he is a distant descendant of Kesser.^^Year 263 - Rebels unite under the leadership of Baatur Bulat, who claims to be the son of Kulak of Dimir's dynasty.^^Year 280 - Anyz and his family are killed by rebels. Olen's children escape to one of Hakkon's provinces. Kirran, the eldest, becomes an oficial, while his younger brother Kuulan becomes the leader of a band of Turan mercenaries employed by Hakkon. Dimir's dynasty is reinstated. Bulat's son - Mangi - becomes the new Hakan. ^^Year 300 - Kirran and Kuulan move to the capital of Hakkon's provinces on The Great Plain. ^^Year 330 - The brothers lead an army of their fellow tribesmen under Hakkon banners to the continent of Perisno. The fleet gets caught in a storm, and Kirran's ship sinks with Kirran's entire family aboard. Having received news of Emperor Comrey II's death, Kuulan chooses to abandon his service to Hakkon.

ip_giantslore|"지식: 수트와 바칼 거인족"
ip_giantslore_text|"The giants of Perisno are an ancient race, perhaps one of the oldest inhabitants- although there is definitely contesting claims to that. Giants as a race, or the 'Suti' in their own tongue, which means children of Sut, an Earthen mother goddess, are tall and muscular with heavy angular features and deep seated eyes. Their size far outpacing humans, both in overall height and mass as well as proportionally with wider shoulders in males and wider hips with females in comparison to other races. Physiologically they breed slower than the other races, and have a lower female to male ratio, female giants often having twins when they give birth to new infants. This has made the race of Giants highly protective of their females, giantesses often staying away from violent activities that may endanger them, often being in charge of home, hearth, supplies and other such things, and craftsgiants- most of the clothing, weapons and armour and day to day tools and objects that aren't imported in via trade being made by the hands of Giantess's.^^Male giants on the other hand, traditionally hunt and go off to fight and are valued less than female Giants. However, despite this most political positions of power are led by male Giants, as the struggles for leadership and intricacies of power are not escaped on Giantkind, a race most other races of Perisno think stupid and simple. And often females form the roles of venerated advisors instead of direct leadership because of the rather large target direct political positions have within a clan; although that isn't to say that the female giants don't contest power among themselves.^^Giants form a largely power based society, mostly focused on either martial might and the ability to impose your will as a male or the skills you have as a craftgiant and able mother or oracle in the case of females.^^Giants used to be spread all across Perisno in close knit family tribes and clans living a hunter gatherer lifestyle, with some Giant clans having settled in small villages across the continent, their main homeland being what is now the Chiefdom of Sut. However, over the centuries and the growth of Elven supremacy and later on human expansionism came persecution of the Giant race. Many races felt intimidated by the size of Giants, as well as by their rather violent capacity in warfare. Prejudice was very common against Giants, especially for realms such as Drachen and others who often, if not outright killing the Giants on sight, enslaved them to force them to work in grueling conditions until they were broken of spirit and body. While the clans of Sut sat settled and prospered in their mountainous homes and forests, the rest of Giantkind across Perisno was driven to the east of the continent in a mass migration.^^Giants refer to this migration as the 'Walk of suffering' or in their own langauge, Gurthu'uk Asht'kar. Preyed upon by bandits and marauders, this migration was characterized by its brutalization of the Suti people as they tried to find an escape from persecution. This was made even worse as the Giants of Sut rejected their kin from settling in their lands, the Giants of Sut fearing that the overcrowding of their territories would lead to mass starvation. The rest of Giant kind remembers this bitterly, causing a great schism between the Giant people. They finally settled on the eastern coasts of Perisno in what is now known as the Kingdom of Bakhal, or simply known back then as, Bakhal- which translates roughly to 'Exiled land' in giant tongue.^^The giants sat in squalor for many many years until a warlord by the name of Vharska united them in battle of succession, forging a mighty confederation of the dispersed tribes of Bakhal under a motive of reclaiming lost glory for Giant kind and revenge upon those whom had persecuted their race, preaching fiery rhetoric of hatred and retribution against their enemies. It wasn't long before Vharska started to push his now militarized people out into other lands, conquering nearby coastal settlements right from the water on large boats and proceeding to conquer, enslave and pillage the lands of humans and others. His descendant to this day does the exact same, remembering his father's rhetoric with fond compassion, the giants of Bakhal with a dream of conquering Perisno for the sake of Giant kind and paying retribution upon their traitorous kin in Sut, and extinguishing the flame of the other races once and for all."

This faction will be formed once the player becomes a monarch under his/her own name.^^History records it as the one true kingdom within the land of Perisno. This kingdom was once a glorious and prosperous empire until it suddenly collapsed, most likely due to internal power struggles. Given the current state of war within the land today, the return of the Perisno Empire is most likely a pitiful and vain dream, nigh impossible.^^However, within the mountains that border Hakkon and Drahara, an ancient ruin remains from the former mighty Perisno Empire. The Third Legion, a noble group of descendants of the ancient empire, still roam the land, opposing every faction and force with hope of reforming the empire and returning it to their ancestors' former glory.^^Another group that wishes for the empire's return are the Perisno Pilgrims, a group of people who are also descended from the ancient empire. These 'Pilgrims', unlike the Third Legion, are descendants of the common people of the Perisno Empire. They wish for the kingdom's peaceful rebirth, and unlike their noble counterparts, they search for a hero with the skills and determination to raise it from the ashes.^^Perisno is a flexible nation, in which policy may be determined by the ruler.

The bastard launched a campaign against his father approximately halfway into the new era. Five cycles later he is fighting a losing war against a father he underestimated. Hearing about the constant fighting of the land over the sea, he decides his last and only option is to retreat into Perisno, conquering as he goes. In order to prevent this, Shang Jin sends one of his Black Warriors (his newphew Shi Jin) to warn the Perisnoan kingdoms of the threat.^^Zann stays behind with a core group of generals to loot what he can from Nadire before departing. He will appear one month after the rest of the Imperial Army, for surely that is all the time it will take to conquer Perisno, he assumes. The Jin Empire followed Zann after they invaded Perisno, deciding they needed to rid their enemy once and for all. This means two invasions, although the Jin Empire is concentrated only on destroying the Zann. They will bring their war from Khergia, Sine, and Shun-Ha to a new front in Perisno, while the other factions, powerless and weak as they are, can only watch.^^The player is the only one who can help the Jin stop the Zann, or even choose to destroy both. The Zann's armies are a hybrid of Mongolian, Japanese, and Chinese style troops. They have formidable archers, strong horse archers, and intimidating infantry.

They used to be an important part of the great Perisno Empire, both by their commerce of metals and jewels, and by their good relations with the Empire's human leaders. They once had twelve great cities, built in the mountain, as symbols of their greatness. No blacksmith in the world could match the skills of a dwarf. They created exquisite jewels and excellent armour. Later the Old Perisno Empire crumbled and fell. And though the dwarves were not part of this Empire, deep inside their mountains, they felt the consequences of this event. When the invasion began, and the elves first landed on the coast of Perisno, they savagely attacked the dwarves, forcing them to abandon some of their lands and cities. Howver, the dwarves are a proud people, who didn't want to see its enemy plunder their lands and live in their cities, so they raided the lands and closed the entrances to their cities.^^For the first time in centuries, the dwarves decided to elect a king. As a matter of fact, each dwarven city was independent, but during the dark ages of the dwarven nation, the dwarven Tarhns elected only one of them as their King. All of them agreed to elect Bluin, the Tarhn of the town of Nimazar, as their respected leader and King. Bluin the First led a massive army of dwarves to take back their lands and kick the elves back into the sea. The dwarrves, however, didn't wage a war for centuries, and even if their warriors were proud, they were too weak. Thousands of dwarves died fighting the elves, and they couldn't raise enough warriors to fight the other invaders. When Tolrania and Hakkon landed on Perisno, the dwarves were only a shadow of their former glory.

They are a strange group and no one knows the exact reason of their split. Some say it was because of a civil war, others say it was because of the Elintorans being a completely different species of Elves who felt they were being treated like a minority. At glance these elves are not different, except for the pattern of their armors. Even so they hate the Elintoran so much that they will attack any Elintoran party in sight. Like the Elintorans, the Geldars are masters of archery. They are as powerful, and to some extent, even stronger than Elintor.^ ^- The Volheere Raiders -^^The Volheere raiders came from the continent of Nisaynia, which is near Perisno. They are a hard people, having to live through the harsh winter climates of their continent. Somehow, they survive through it yearly, but the past decade has been particularly rough to them. They believe that their god, Woden, has forsaken them and they are no longer worthy people. They decided that they are not 'holy' enough to live on the land of Nisaynia, where their gods roam. The entire Volheere people sailed away, and happened to come to Perisno. They landed on the coasts and sacked everything they could find. Since then, they have established themselves as a minor power in Perisno. Their berserkers are a feared group, and the leader, Ulfhednar, is a formidable man. It will take a strong hero to defeat the Volheere raiders and wipe them off the face of the earth.^ ^- The Demon Worshippers & Order of the Eagle -^^The Demon Worshippers have always been in Perisno, preaching and trying to spread their vile beliefs. Most sensible men ignored them and told their children stories of the Worshippers to scare them but there are always some foolish men that fall under the beliefs of Demons. The Demon Worshippers are ordered in a hierarchy, with the Demon Lord at the top. None of them are actually demons, but there are rumors that recently research has been made by the Demon Worshippers to really summon Demons into the world through the Underworld. Whether this is true or not remains for the player to decide (and find out).^^The Order of the Eagle was founded at around the year 308, to combat these Demon Worshippers. They started out golden and pure, swearing to uphold justice and honor wherever they went. That was long ago. Now, the Order of the Eagle and the Demon Worshippers only have one difference: their beliefs. The Order of the Eagle are now vile and greedy, lead by the Patriarch, and they use intimidation to force other lords to give them funds for their numerous campaigns against 'heretics'. The Order has been mortal enemies with the Demon Worshippers since their foundation, and it still remains so. However, there are rumors of a secret weapon they are creating to permanently wipe out the Demon Worshippers from the world. Whether this is true or not remains for the player to discover as he progresses through Perisno.^ ^- The Syrin Nomads -^^The Syrin nomads are migrating from their homeland, called the Aelston Desert. After living in their home for hundreds of years, the desert became uninhabitable. Some say the Gods themselves were the cause of this. The entire nation had to migrate, and so they did. After traveling through vast and cruel deserts, the situation was becoming hopeless, until one day, they chanced upon a settlement. The people there said they were ruled by the Draharans. The Syrins, lead by Queen Zolona, decided that it would become the perfect home for them. So began the war between the Draharan nation and the Syrin nomads, in the year 365. The war goes on still, and now Zolona ravages the Draharan countryside, angry for her failures attacking the Draharan castle. It is up to the player to eliminate this threat.^ ^- The New God & Old God Followers -^^The tension between the Maccavian Lords are becoming more and more evident. Maccavia is a nation on the brink of civil war, and its neighbors watch with hungry eyes as it looms closer. On one side are the followers of the Old Gods, who do not tolerate the New Gods followers. Both think each other heretics and the beliefs have torn apart families and friends. King Agathor Krex leads the Maccavian Old Gods followers and the New Gods Followers are a Republic. These factions have both selected elite troops, the Holy Crusaders for the New Gods and the Divine Aethlings for the Old. It is up to the player to decide whether he wants to follow the path of the Old Gods or the New Gods, or none of them.^ ^- The Illica Falki -^^The Illica clan is living at the top of the mountain ranges north-east of Persino. They've befriended a mystical bird-like beast living on the mountain, the Falki. Young children from the clan are chosen by a child Falki, to grow up together, and become companions. When both reach adulthood, they will be sent to hunt in all around the mountain ranges. In the past the Illica used to be a mighty clan of all Perisno's native inhabitants. First Elintor and after that the Reich Des Drachen invaded and tried to force them into submission. The Illica clan was forced back to castle Sky, their home. Because of that, the Illica clan hates all foreign immigrants to Perisno. They have a very bad relationship with Elintor and Reich Des Drachen. Often they send various parties to sabotage the Reich's caravans and even to attack the Reich lords' army.^^Zeladeck, Illica's greatest Falki Knight was not an Illica to begin with. He was an orphan raised by a lumberjack couple, living in the forest near the mountain range of the Illica. One day, he found a big injured Falki in the forest, and tended its wound. Nursing the Falki all day long for half a year, Zel and the Falki became best friends. The Falki then regained its strength, and took Zel to the Illica clan, only to reveal that that Falki is a direct descendant of the Sky King, the strongest and most respected Falki. He was 10 by that time. Zeladeck was then trained, and with his gifted ability of a warrior, plus the good teamwork between him and his Falki, he soon became the greatest Falki Knight at the age of only 19. Some time after that, he went back to this home, only to see the abandoned wreck of what used to be his home. Raged, he alone went to the Reich, in order to find out the wherabouts of his parents and then take his vengeance. There he met a Drachenritter whose power was on-par with his and they fought one whole day without a winner. Not satisfied with the result, he went back to Illica to assemble his followers and try to settle the score, once and for all.^ ^- The Foreign Invaders -^^The Foreign Invaders come from the Continent of Nisaynia, where the Volheere Raiders also originate from. They are called the Foreign Invaders, but their real name is the Rafkla Clan. While conducting a naval raid on another clan, a huge wind blew their ships away and scattered them, and after sailing for many days, half of them landed on Reich lands in Perisno while the other half landed in the Draharan deserts. Their Clan 'King', Rafklazan, is desperate for a way home although he seems to be enjoying looting the countryside and wrecking caravans in Perisno better than Nisaynia. The Foreign Invaders will be a large threat to the player, as they have big parties of troops. However, if the player manages to kill them, the rewards and loot will be great.^ ^- The Wolf Knights -^^The Wolf Knights were founded recently by a man named Lupus, who claimed he could communicate with wolves. He founded his Order, the Wolf Knights, with the sole purpose of claiming the land around him as his own. The Wolf Knights grew very powerful, and soon the land they wanted became theirs. Their top tier Wolf Constables are almost impossible to stop, and some say that they have been given the strength and speed of wolves. There are rumors that they ride wolves as well, although there is no proof. The Wolf Knights are at war with their neighbors, the Reich, Drahara, and Maccavia. Even the formidable Reich Dragoners are no match for the Wolf Knights, proven in countless battles. The Wolf Knights are also very secretive, and no one knows where their headquarters is. If the player should meet these knights, wandering in small parties of 5 to 10, then he/she should be careful, because even 5 of these knights and 1 constable can do significant damage to a well trained army.^ ^- The Lymbardian Knights -^^The Lymbardian Knights are the local knights of their region, the County of Lymbar. They owe their allegiance to no one, even though their geographic location suggests otherwise. They were founded by a Count of Lymbard a long time ago, long before Tolrania sailed to Perisno and when the Venetor Empire ruled. They have patrolled their land ever since their foundation, and continue to do so even after hundreds of years. They are hostile to anyone who comes into their land and so naturally, they will be hostile to the player. While their knights aren't the best, they can still pack a punch so be careful of them, especially early in game.^ ^- The Desouk Slavers -^^It is unknown exactly when the Desouk Slavers started their business, but they have become very successful at it. In fact, they are so successful at their trade that most of their parties consist of many slaves. The Desouk Slavers do their dark business only for gold, and are mortal enemies of the Manhunters and other slave trader groups. They occupy mainly the land around Desouk, but their influence is spreading steadily and soon their slave trade network may move through even to Tolrania. They will be a minor nuisance to the player, but a nuisance nevertheless.^ ^- The Ankars -^^The Ankars are matriarchal society and only women are allowed to lead or have positions of leadership. The men are usually slaves and prisoners of war who are killed after their uses are spent. Any male sons are also killed, and the females are trained from an early age to fight. The Ankars also have Priests to conduct these rituals and sometimes fight on the frontline, wielding huge swords but little armor. The Ankars have been in Perisno for many years and have never wandered past their territory, in the Tolranian Forests. Orders like the Order of the Eagle and the Wolf Knights think they are abnormal and need to be killed. Because of their location, they fight frequently with Tolrania and the Tolranian Outlaws inhabiting the forests.^ ^- Mercenaries -^^As you explore Perisno, you will notice that there are often large parties of mercenaries roaming around the map. These heartless souls care for nothing but gold and would do anything to get it. There are parties of both male and female mercenaries alike that wander Perisno, looking for throats to cut and people to hire them. Some parties are large while others are small and concentrated, but every one of them will pose a threat to the player.^ ^- The Third Legion -^^The Third Legion is a remnant of the ancient Venetor Empire, the first great power to inhabit Perisno. It is said that the Venetor Empire, under the prodigious Emperor Trilond, used to rule the better part of the world, and that there was not a remote corner of the land that their fame had not touched. At the time, the Third Legion was Emperor Trilond�s most prestigious army division, and many men of the Third served in his personal guard regiment. The Third Legion�s leader, or Atanos, in the days of the Empire was a charismatic man named Octiem.^^In the year 67, however, Emperor Trilond fell ill in his old age. After his death, there was tremendous infighting within the Venetor aristocracy for his position and, by 68, the provisional government had failed to select a candidate. Seeing certain doom in the future of Venetor, Octiem�s Third and a small group of civilian supporters fled the crumbling Empire and took refuge in southern Perisno, around modern-day Amarna. They watched in shock as the centuries of civilization they had been a part of crumbled to the ground in a series of rebellions, and soon Octiem and his followers were the only intact memory of their glorious Empire.^^For over two centuries, the Third Legion and the few other surviving members of Venetor kept their traditions and customs safe. Based out of an old military outpost that had been relatively untouched by the Empire�s fall, the Third bravely defended against  increasingly prevalent threats on the Perisno mainland. First it was the Demon Worshippers, then the mischievous Redwood Elves, and now the Third finds themselves surrounded by many diverse cultures that all present a threat to the ways of the old. Now lead by a direct descendant of Atanos Octiem that goes by the same name, the Third Legion wishes to once again expand their powers from coast to Perisnoan coast, to raise their long lost Venetor Empire from the ruins and expel all those that stand in their way.^ ^- The Mosoru Riders -^^The Mosoru Riders occupy the desert lands separating the Dwarven nation from the rest of Perisno. They are a fierce proud people, and do not care for outsiders. They tend to keep to themselves but they claim the entirety of the desert beyond the mountain's theirs, so If you venture into their homeland, you may regret it. The Mosoru ride horses, and you will find both male and female warriors in battle. The male riders ride into battle with two swords, but no shield. The Female rider's on the other hand equip both a bow and a sword.^ ^- The Ukundu -^^The Ukundu people are native to the continent of Nisaynia. Although they share their land with the Volheere Raiders and the Rafkla Clan, the Ukundu live in the remote jungles of Nisaynia far away from the other two clans and even further from Perisno. It is only through the tales picked up by Ukundu travellers from the recently-returned King Rafklazan that they learned of the prosperous and dangerous land of Perisno. Having conquered the Ukundu's home jungle and surrounding area, King Ukundu was keenly awaiting an opportunity to expand his influence and power. Therefore, upon hearing of the opportunities for blood and glory in this foreign land, he quickly assembled a force of his best warriors and set off on his voyage. Having now arrived on the Perisno mainland and set up an area of operations around Drahara territory in the east, the Ukundu war parties are a menace to smaller armies and their leader is said to patrol the deserts with over five-hundred exotic fighters.^^The Ukundu's army is exceptional for two reasons. The first reason is that it is comprised mostly of women. In the Ukundu culture, men traditionally take the roles of craftsmen and artisans, while women are trained to ride and hunt with sword and spear. Although men tend to be stronger in one-on-one combat, women have a unique talent which is explained by the second reason: the high-tier Ukundu troops ride tigers into battle. The species of tiger endemic to Ukundu jungles are ferocious and swift animals, however they are highly resistant to being ridden by male humans. Even King Ukundu himself must resort to riding the slower (albeit more well-armored) rhino. Only in very rare cases will a male be accepted onto the back of an Ukundu tiger."
